This is post number 465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and hosting location – but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly communication.\n\n### [When your journal reads you]()\nPublished April 14, 2021 in [Elephant in the Lab](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/elephantinthelab)<br />Elias Koch<br /><br /><strong>Introduction</strong> Renke Siems  In December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted by the Coalition for Networked Information. The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.\n\n### [What’s going on with <i>Oculudentavis</i>?]([https://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77](https://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77)\n<br />)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77](https://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77)\n<br />Published July 22, 2020 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Mike Taylor<br /><br />Back in March, Nature published “Hummingbird-sized dinosaur from the Cretaceous period of Myanmar” by Xing et al. (2020), which described and named a tiny putative bird that was preserved in amber from Myanmar (formerly Burma). It’s a pretty spectacular find. Today, though, that paper is retracted.

I saw this post with a bar chart to visualise these citations. It didn’t quite capture what the effect (if any) a retraction has on citations. I thought I’d quickly plot this out for the number one article on the list.    The plot is pretty depressing. The retraction has no effect on citations.\n\n### [The <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i> vs Elsevier]([https://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28](https://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28)\n<br />)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28](https://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28)\n<br />Published May 6, 2015 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Matt Wedel<br /><br />While Mike’s been off having fun at the Royal Society, this has been happening: Lots of feathers flying right now over the situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA).
