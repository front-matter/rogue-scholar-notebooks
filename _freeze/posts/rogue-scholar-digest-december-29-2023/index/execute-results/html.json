Sathe<br />We are amidst a revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we aim to share our early experience with creating custom AI-powered chatbots in surgical education. While our versions are prototypes, we hypothesize that similar chatbots will one day play a significant role in the field. In brief, AI is the ability of a computer to perform human-like tasks.\n\n\n\n### [rOpenSci News Digest, December 2023](https://doi.org/10.59350/p9jf2-7d310)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/p9jf2-7d310](https://doi.org/10.59350/p9jf2-7d310)\n<br />Published December 22, 2023 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />The rOpenSci Team<br />Dear rOpenSci friends, it’s time for our monthly news roundup!

I received a Plant Study Grant from the BSBI to work on this in the Summer of 2022 but as it turned out I had committed to a much bigger project than I first thought! I recently submitted my records and can now finally say I have finished my first large recording project.\n\n\n\n### [The German DEAL contracts](https://doi.org/10.59350/vfqbq-13430)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/vfqbq-13430](https://doi.org/10.59350/vfqbq-13430)\n<br />Published December 28, 2023 in [Sci:Debug](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/scidebug)<br />Ulrich Herb<br />As some people abroad were interested in my earlier posts on the German DEAL contracts, I have decided to summarise here some key points of the new contracts with Wiley, Springer Nature and Elsevier.\n\n\n\n### [Molecules of the year: 2023](https://doi.org/10.59350/38f12-9qe48)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/38f12-9qe48](https://doi.org/10.59350/38f12-9qe48)\n<br />Published December 28, 2023 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />The Science education unit at the ACS publication C&amp;EN publishes its list of molecules of the year (as selected by the editors and voted upon by the readers) in December. Here are some observations about three of this year’s batch. Diberyllocene[1] with its unusual Be-Be bond has already beeen covered on this blog.[2], where I commented that lithioborocene should be possible to make as well.\n\n\n\n### [Three new userscripts for Wikidata](https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307](https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307)\n<br />Published December 28, 2023 in [Syntaxus baccata](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/syntaxus_baccata)<br />Lars Willighagen<br />Today I worked on three user scripts for Wikidata. Together, these tools hopefully make the data in Wikidata more accessible and make it easier to navigate between items. To enable these, include one or more of the following lines in your common.js (depending on which script(s) you want): mw.loader.load('//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lagewi/properties.js&amp;oldid=2039401177&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript');\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
