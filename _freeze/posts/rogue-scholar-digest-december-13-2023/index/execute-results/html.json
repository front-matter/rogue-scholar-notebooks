My work is pretty interdisciplinary, but it shocked me, too, that I’m apparently holding forth on neoliberalism and the epistemic question in African universities (archive link):   Figure 1: Apparently, I’m commenting on neoliberalism in African universities.\n\n\n\n### [Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) is now available in 120+ countres.

But it was not always so and when I came across an old plan indicating how the chemistry department at Imperial College was connected in 1989, I was struck by how much has happened in the 34 years since. Nowadays all the infrastructures needed are effectively “built in” to the building when it is constructed and few are even aware of them.\n\n\n\n### [Documentation, documentation, documentation](https://doi.org/10.53731/fgyjr-hg721)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/fgyjr-hg721](https://doi.org/10.53731/fgyjr-hg721)\n<br />Published December 7, 2023 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />Writing software is more than writing code – good documentation is one essential aspect. A lot of the tools and libraries that make writing documentation easier use markdown as a file format, combined with metadata in yaml format and optionally some additional functionality, e.g. mdx – which combines markdown with jsx for JSX-based projects such as React.\n\n\n\n### [Make-or-buy decisions in research and research software](https://doi.org/10.59350/6q2e5-hhs87)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/6q2e5-hhs87](https://doi.org/10.59350/6q2e5-hhs87)\n<br />Published December 7, 2023 in [Daniel S. Katz's blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/danielskatz)<br />Daniel S. Katz<br />Make-or-buy decisions are common in business and research. They often involve an analysis of the pros and cons of creating something (e.g., a physical item, software, a service) vs. acquiring it from someone else.\n\n\n\n### [How sauropods increased the size of ventral neck muscles](https://doi.org/10.59350/7ppge-gpg13)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/7ppge-gpg13](https://doi.org/10.59350/7ppge-gpg13)\n<br />Published December 8, 2023 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Mike Taylor<br />Last time I promised you exciting news about sauropod neck-muscle mass. Let none say that I do not fulfil covenents. And, as usual, when talking about sauropod neck muscle mass, I’m going to start by talking about bird legs. Look at this flamingo: Ridiculous, right? Those legs are like matchsticks. How can they possibly work.\n\n\n\n### [Brief thoughts on qualitative and quantitative projects](https://doi.org/10.59350/tpx31-qby94)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/tpx31-qby94](https://doi.org/10.59350/tpx31-qby94)\n<br />Published December 10, 2023 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Mike Taylor<br />Back in the first post about our recent paper on bifurcated cervical ribs in apatosaurines, I noted: I’m fond of this one because it’s pleasingly low-tech and traditional.\n\n\n\n### [The journey from Journal &#8220;ESI&#8221; to FAIR data objects: An eighteen year old (continuing) experiment.](https://doi.org/10.59350/g2p77-78m14)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/g2p77-78m14](https://doi.org/10.59350/g2p77-78m14)\n<br />Published December 10, 2023 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />Around 1996, journals started publishing what became known as “ESI” or electronic supporting information, alongside the articles themselves, as a mechanism for exposing the data associated with the research being reported and exploiting some of the new opportunities offered by the World Wide Web. From the outset, such ESI was expressed as a paginated Acrobat file, with the Web being merely a convenient document delivery mechanism.\n\n\n\n### [Type I Error Rates are Not Usually Inflated](https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573](https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573)\n<br />Published December 10, 2023 in [Critical Metascience](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/markrubin)<br />Mark Rubin<br />The inflation of Type I error rates is thought to be one of the causes of the replication crisis. Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this new article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\n\n### [No Synths! Use of AI in scientific publications](https://doi.org/10.59350/axrsb-4kz33)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/axrsb-4kz33](https://doi.org/10.59350/axrsb-4kz33)\n<br />Published December 10, 2023 in [quantixed](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/quantixed)<br />Stephen Royle<br />Bands have been known to declare “No Synths!” on their albums. This statement was a badge of pride indicating that the artists hadn’t used any modern trickery in their recordings. Today, the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in science has created a similar scenario. Advocates argue that these tools improve every aspect of science, including the publication process.\n\n\n\n### [How to create separate bibliographies in a Quarto document](https://doi.org/10.59350/5dvez-q6817)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/5dvez-q6817](https://doi.org/10.59350/5dvez-q6817)\n<br />Published December 11, 2023 in [Andrew Heiss's blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/andrewheiss)<br />Andrew Heiss<br /><i>\n</i>\ntl;dr  If you want to skip the explanation and justification for why you might want separate bibliographies, you can skip down to the example section, or just go see some example files at GitHub. Why use separate bibliographies? In academic articles, it’s common to have a supplemental appendix with extra tables, figures, robustness checks, additional math, proofs, and other details.\n\n\n\n### [Archiving individual science blog posts](https://doi.org/10.53731/5vvnh-tnm55)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/5vvnh-tnm55](https://doi.org/10.53731/5vvnh-tnm55)\n<br />Published December 11, 2023 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />Sometimes we want to preserve a blog post to read or reuse later. There are generic tools for that purpose, including read-it-later apps such as Instapaper or Pocket. For scholarly blog posts, the right place can also be a reference manager, which stores the content and the metadata, especially if a DOI was registered for each blog post. Reference managers can store full-text documents and typically use PDF as the file format.\n\n\n\n### [What I learned from getting bodied by a robot.](https://doi.org/10.59350/r8k9q-zdm06)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/r8k9q-zdm06](https://doi.org/10.59350/r8k9q-zdm06)\n<br />Published December 12, 2023 in [Chris von Csefalvay](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chrisvoncsefalvay)<br />Chris von Csefalvay<br />Say you’re busing tables and you’re trying to pass someone in a wheelchair. What do you do? Do you say “excuse me” and wait for them to move? Do you say “excuse me” and then try to pass them? Do you just try to pass them? Do you say nothing and just try to pass them? All of these are, actually, pretty legitimate answers. Now, say you’re a robot.\n\n\n\n### [VU Amsterdam supports ResearchEquals](https://doi.org/10.59350/tx9hq-akz97)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/tx9hq-akz97](https://doi.org/10.59350/tx9hq-akz97)\n<br />Published December 12, 2023 in [Liberate Science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/libscie)<br />Chris Hartgerink<br />VU Amsterdam is now a supporting member of ResearchEquals, sustaining and governing the development of modular publishing.
