I want this so that I can post without worrying about contributing to “pollution” of the scholarly record. I can accomplish this by tagging posts as #scholarly when I want them to be e.g. fetched by The Rogue Scholar for DOI minting and for subsequent linking to my ORCiD profile. This post should hopefully be my last act of such pollution.\n\n\n### [Beginner’s Guide to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Keras](https://doi.org/10.59350/9c8e6-hca47)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/9c8e6-hca47](https://doi.org/10.59350/9c8e6-hca47)\n<br />Published April 8, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Wenyi Pi<br />Understanding Sequential Data Modelling with Keras for Time Series Prediction\n<strong>\n Author\n</strong>\nWenyi Pi (\n<strong>\n ORCID\n</strong>\n: 0009–0002–2884–2771) Introduction   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a special type of neural networks that are suitable for learning representations of sequential data like text in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will walk through a complete example of using RNNs for time series prediction, covering\n\n\n### [Undermind.ai - a different type of AI agent style search optimized for high recall?](https://doi.org/10.59350/4g3nh-6e089)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/4g3nh-6e089](https://doi.org/10.59350/4g3nh-6e089)\n<br />Published April 9, 2024 in [Aaron Tay's Musings about librarianship](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/musings)<br />Aaron Tay<br />In the last blog post , I argued that despite the advancements in AI thanks to transformer based large language models, most academic search still are focused mostly in supporting exploratory searches and do not focus on optimizing recall and in fact trade off low latency for accuracy.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
