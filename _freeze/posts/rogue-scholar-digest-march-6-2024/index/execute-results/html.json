One of the many frustrating things about Shiny lately has been around buttons. Well, it wasn’t really about buttons, but that’s where it started. I noticed that a number of buttons - some having file inputs, some having text inputs - did not trigger every time, and I expected them to trigger every time no matter what.\n\n\n### [Harnessing The Power of Knowledge Graphs in Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.59350/2r9ae-ayf81)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/2r9ae-ayf81](https://doi.org/10.59350/2r9ae-ayf81)\n<br />Published March 4, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Research Graph<br /><strong>\n Unlocking the Power of Questions — A deep dive into Question Answering Systems\n</strong>\n<strong>\n Author:\n</strong>\n<strong>\n Amanda Kau (ORCID:\n</strong>\n<strong>\n 0009–0004–4949–9284\n</strong>\n<strong>\n )\n</strong>\nVirtual assistants have popped up on numerous websites over the years.\n\n\n### [How to use GPT-4V For Stoplight Report](https://doi.org/10.59350/j1hby-pt034)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/j1hby-pt034](https://doi.org/10.59350/j1hby-pt034)\n<br />Published March 4, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Research Graph<br /><strong>\n Efficient creation of a stoplight report with data dashboard images\n</strong>\n<strong>\n Author:\n</strong>\nYunzhong Zhang (ORCID: 0009–0002–8177–419X) Comparing data dashboards is crucial for understanding trends and performance differences.
