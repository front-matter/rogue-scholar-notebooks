A FAIR data comment on a Strontium Metallocene.](https://doi.org/10.59350/cvzze-k0171)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/cvzze-k0171](https://doi.org/10.59350/cvzze-k0171)\n<br />Published December 29, 2023 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />I will approach this example of a molecule-of-the-year candidate – in fact the eventual winner in the reader poll – from the point of view of data. Its a metallocene arranged in the form of a ring comprising 18 sub-units.[1] Big enough to deserve a 3D model rather than the static images you almost invariably get in journals (and C&amp;EN). So how does one go to the journal and acquire the coordinates for such a model?\n\n\n\n### [The ribs of <i>Brachiosaurus</i>: stranger than you thought](https://doi.org/10.59350/kyae8-p9k09)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/kyae8-p9k09](https://doi.org/10.59350/kyae8-p9k09)\n<br />Published December 30, 2023 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Mike Taylor<br />As we’ve often observed, it’s a funny thing that incredibly well-known dinosaur specimens can sit around for decades, or for more than a century, before someone notices something fascinating about them. One lesson to learn from this is the importance of collections — their creation, maintenance and accessibility.\n\n\n\n### [Running Around: 2023 running dataviz in R](https://doi.org/10.59350/mw56m-xhs52)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/mw56m-xhs52](https://doi.org/10.59350/mw56m-xhs52)\n<br />Published December 31, 2023 in [quantixed](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/quantixed)<br />Stephen Royle<br />2023 has been a great year in running for me. Previous running round-ups are here (2022, 2021).  My two main goals for 2023 were to run 3000 km and also to run 50 HM-or-more distance runs. I managed both with a couple of weeks left. I also bagged new PBs for 5K, 10K and half marathon as well as a handful of segments on Strava. I won no races but I did win two little running competitions at work.\n\n\n\n### [Citation.js: 2023 in review](https://doi.org/10.59350/n40n3-r6b47)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/n40n3-r6b47](https://doi.org/10.59350/n40n3-r6b47)\n<br />Published December 31, 2023 in [Syntaxus baccata](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/syntaxus_baccata)<br />Lars Willighagen<br />This past year was relatively quiet for Citation.js, as changes to the more prominent components (BibTeX, RIS, Wikidata) start to slow down. I believe this is a good sign, and that it indicates the quality of the mappings is high.\n\n\n\n### [Books for 2023](https://doi.org/10.59350/r4za3-n4562)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/r4za3-n4562](https://doi.org/10.59350/r4za3-n4562)\n<br />Published December 31, 2023 in [Corin Wagen](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/cwagen)<br />Corin Wagen<br />(Previously: 2022) #1.
