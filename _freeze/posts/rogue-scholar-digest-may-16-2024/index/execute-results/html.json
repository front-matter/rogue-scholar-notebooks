It’s one of the states I never ever think about:  …and it’s just so\n<em>\n small\n</em>\n.  Amid the joking, my wife came to Rhode Island’s defense by declaring that even though it’s so small, it has one of the highest proportions of coastline to land borders.\n\n\n### [Voter Turnout Among General Surgery Residents in the 2022 U.S. Midterm Election](https://doi.org/10.59350/0vknr-rwv45)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/0vknr-rwv45](https://doi.org/10.59350/0vknr-rwv45)\n<br />Published May 8, 2024 in [I.D.E.A.S.](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ideas)<br />Tejas S. Sathe<br />As residents within the healthcare profession, our first duty is to care for our patients. While working upwards of 80 hours per week pursuing that mission, it is hard to think of ourselves as anything beyond our job title. But we are also citizens. And while patient care remains a worthy North Star, decisions made by faraway policymakers can impact our patients as much as the assessments and plans we ourselves craft.\n\n\n### [Generative Linker Design](https://doi.org/10.59350/mqb61-x2x15)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/mqb61-x2x15](https://doi.org/10.59350/mqb61-x2x15)\n<br />Published May 10, 2024 in [Corin Wagen](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/cwagen)<br />Corin Wagen<br />Much molecular design today can be boiled down to “put the right functional groups in exactly the right places.” In catalysis, proper positioning of functional groups to complement developing charge or engage in other stabilizing non-covalent interactions with the transition state can lead to vast rate accelerations.\n\n\n### [Why EXACTLY is Google Scholar bad for evidence synthesis, systematic reviews?](https://doi.org/10.59350/e1f2p-39w75)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/e1f2p-39w75](https://doi.org/10.59350/e1f2p-39w75)\n<br />Published May 12, 2024 in [Aaron Tay's Musings about librarianship](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/musings)<br />Aaron Tay<br />Let's be clear here,\n<i>\n Google Scholar is ill designed for use for systematic reviews\n</i>\n. I am not trying to argue otherwise. (Obligatory warning, I am not a real systematic review librarian) But why exactly?\n\n\n### [How to use Large Language Models to tag your data: A complete tutorial](https://doi.org/10.59350/z1z3k-rrm02)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/z1z3k-rrm02](https://doi.org/10.59350/z1z3k-rrm02)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Xuzeng He<br />Using Mistral for Data tagging  Author   · Xuzeng He (\n<strong>\n ORCID:\n</strong>\n0009–0005–7317–7426) Introduction   Data tagging, in simple terms, is the process of assigning labels or tags to your data so that they are easier to retrieve or analyse.\n\n\n### [Automated Knowledge Graph Construction with Large Language Models — Part 2](https://doi.org/10.59350/4c2mx-vm853)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/4c2mx-vm853](https://doi.org/10.59350/4c2mx-vm853)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Amanda Kau<br />Automated Knowledge Graph Construction with Large Language Models — Part 2\n<strong>\n Harvesting the Power and Knowledge of Large Language Models\n</strong>\nAuthor  Amanda Kau (\n<strong>\n ORCID\n</strong>\n:\n<strong>\n 0009–0004–4949–9284\n</strong>\n) Introduction   Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a structured representation of data in a graphical format, in which entities are represented by nodes and are connected by edges representing relationships\n\n\n### [Do bifurcated ribs imply single-segment neck muscles?

Those of\n<em>\n Turiasaurus\n</em>\nare one of the autapomorphies proposed by Royo-Torres et al. (2006:figure 1K). Their diagnosis of the new genus included “accessory process projecting caudodorsally from the dorsal margin of the shafts of proximal cervical ribs”. Here is the best example of such a rib in\n<em>\n Turiasaurus\n</em>\n, attached to its vertebra.\n\n\n### [Finding Equilibrium in a Hyperconnected World: The Struggle Against Burnout](https://doi.org/10.59350/9rxbb-45j13)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/9rxbb-45j13](https://doi.org/10.59350/9rxbb-45j13)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Everything is Connected](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ernestopriego)<br />Ernesto Priego<br /><strong>\n I\n</strong>\n‘ve lost count of how often I start my blog posts by admitting I haven’t blogged in a while. Long-form blogging seems to be on its way out, but it still holds a unique place in social media—it’s a constant source of guilt, never feeling frequent, good, seen, or shared enough. Now that’s out of the way, I want to briefly share some thoughts I’ve been mulling over recently.\n\n\n### [Regime shift still cometh?](https://doi.org/10.59350/tg0py-yd761)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/tg0py-yd761](https://doi.org/10.59350/tg0py-yd761)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/jabberwocky_ecology)<br />Morgan Ernest<br />Back when I had optimistic views of my time, I vowed to do more blogging this year. Sadly, life had other plans. But I return with an update to an earlier post on the Portal rodent community. To recap, in April 2023, my student Pat Dumandan and I were afraid. Afraid that\n<em>\n Chaetodipus penicillatus\n</em>\n(the Desert pocket mouse) was about to undergo a population explosion.\n\n\n### [Going for DOI registration](https://doi.org/10.53731/43qt9-x6p52)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/43qt9-x6p52](https://doi.org/10.53731/43qt9-x6p52)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />Starting this week, all DOIs for the Rogue Scholar blog posts are registered and updated using the new commonmeta Go library, replacing the commonmeta Python library. Authors and readers of blogs archived by Rogue Scholar shouldn't notice a difference, but going forward this change will make it easier to manage the DOIs (close to 16K DOIs for currently 93 blogs) registered for Rogue Scholar blog posts.\n\n\n### [There’s no such thing as sustainable research software](https://doi.org/10.59350/naakc-7h373)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/naakc-7h373](https://doi.org/10.59350/naakc-7h373)\n<br />Published May 13, 2024 in [Daniel S.

Katz<br />(with contributions from Michelle Barker, Neil Chue Hong, Matthew Turk, Jeffrey Carver, Hannah Cohoon, and James Howison)  Ok, this title is a bit of a teaser, but what I really mean is that while we can say that research software has been sustained, we can’t predict with certainty that it will be sustained in the future, or even fully know what factors we should use to make an uncertain prediction.\n\n\n### [Ride That Ridm: A New Session on Mixcloud, or, A Note On Vinyl-only Sets as Erfahrung](https://doi.org/10.59350/h5e0p-57057)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/h5e0p-57057](https://doi.org/10.59350/h5e0p-57057)\n<br />Published May 14, 2024 in [Everything is Connected](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ernestopriego)<br />Ernesto Priego<br /><strong>\n I\n</strong>\n‘ve written here before about what it means to me to spend some time playing records and recording them the sessions to share later (also here).
