Epistemic security has to do with things like the spreading of misinformation on social media. I.e. if we spend enough time on social media reading unreliable information, how does that influence us? That’s a matter of epistemic security. Epistemic security is interesting because if you start a conversation about epistemic security at a party, they don’t invite you back.\n\n\n\n### [Every Rogue Scholar blog post now also available in JATS XML format](https://doi.org/10.53731/3w1ye-q6z42)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/3w1ye-q6z42](https://doi.org/10.53731/3w1ye-q6z42)\n<br />Published January 10, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />On Monday the Rogue Scholar science blog archive added support for exporting the blog posts in various formats: markdown, ePub, and PDF. Today I am adding another export format: JATS XML, the standard format for scholarly articles. JATS is again automatically generated with the Pandoc universal document converter, with some initial tweaks of the Rogue Scholar metadata.\n\n\n\n### [Type I Error Rates are Not Usually Inflated](https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573](https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573)\n<br />Published January 11, 2024 in [Critical Metascience](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/markrubin)<br />Mark Rubin<br />The inflation of Type I error rates is thought to be one of the causes of the replication crisis. Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\n\n### [The speed (or lack thereof) of science](https://doi.org/10.59350/nktxq-g6v29)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/nktxq-g6v29](https://doi.org/10.59350/nktxq-g6v29)\n<br />Published January 11, 2024 in [bjoern.brembs.blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/brembs)<br />Björn Brembs<br />It was my freshman year, 1991. I was enthusiastic to finally be learning about biology, after being forced to waste a year in the German army’s compulsory service at the time. Little did I know that it was the same year a research paper was published that would guide the direction of my career to this day, more than 30 years later. Many of the links in this post will go to old web pages I created while learning about this research.\n\n\n\n### [rOpenSci 2023 Code of Conduct Transparency Report](https://doi.org/10.59350/k1t8d-pem58)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/k1t8d-pem58](https://doi.org/10.59350/k1t8d-pem58)\n<br />Published January 12, 2024 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Yanina Bellini Saibene, Mark Padgham, Kara Woo<br />The rOpenSci community is supported by our Code of Conduct with a clear description of unacceptable behaviors,instructions on how to make a report, and information on how reports are handled.

Although this is in some respects a minor paper, I’m fond of it because it fell into place so quickly and easily.\n\n\n\n### [Scholarly journals vs Scholarly Blogs.](https://doi.org/10.59350/yt66x-pe726)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/yt66x-pe726](https://doi.org/10.59350/yt66x-pe726)\n<br />Published January 12, 2024 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />First, a very brief history of scholarly publishing, starting in 1665[1] when scientific journals started to be published by learned societies. This model continued until the 1950s, when commercial publishers such as Pergamon Press started with their USP (unique selling point) of rapid time to publication of ~3 months,[2] compared to typical times for many learned society publishers of 2 years or longer.\n\n\n\n### [Improved PDF-formatted Rogue Scholar blog posts](https://doi.org/10.53731/mndd9-1d509)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/mndd9-1d509](https://doi.org/10.53731/mndd9-1d509)\n<br />Published January 12, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />On Monday the Rogue Scholar science blog archive launched the export of blog posts in PDF and other formats. Over the last few days I have been busy improving the PDF output, and today I am releasing a new version, available for all the more than 13K science blog posts archived by Rogue Scholar. The PDF is generated using the open source Pandoc universal document converter in combination with the Weasyprint library.\n\n\n\n### [A Decade of FAIR – what happens next?

If I had known back at the start of my diagnosis what I know now, I do not know for sure that things would be very different, but there was a heck of a lot I did not know. How complex is this disease and the things it does? This complex:    “Rheumatoid arthritis” sounds like the sort of disease that old people get that isn’t very serious.\n\n\n\n### [Scopus: caught-out and shirking responsibility](https://doi.org/10.59350/dc6zg-vk273)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/dc6zg-vk273](https://doi.org/10.59350/dc6zg-vk273)\n<br />Published January 14, 2024 in [A blog by Ross Mounce](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rossmounce)<br />Ross Mounce<br />In December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in\n<em>\n Science\n</em>\nmagazine [1], that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication scams whereby authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have their work published on a website that looks like a real scholarly journal but is in fact not a proper journal, merely an impersonation of one.\n\n\n\n### [How to Update a Translation with Babeldown](https://doi.org/10.59350/3w9fd-8d411)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/3w9fd-8d411](https://doi.org/10.59350/3w9fd-8d411)\n<br />Published January 16, 2024 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Maëlle Salmon<br />As part of rOpenSci’s multilingual publishing project\n<sup>\n 1\n</sup>\n,  we have been developing the  babeldown R package, for translating Markdown-based content using the DeepL API.\n\n\n\n### [Starting at data.org](https://doi.org/10.59350/5a08g-z5214)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/5a08g-z5214](https://doi.org/10.59350/5a08g-z5214)\n<br />Published January 16, 2024 in [Chris Hartgerink](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chjh)<br />Chris Hartgerink<br />In October, I shared I started to look for a regular job --- last week, I started as a senior software engineer for data.org until end of 2025.

As a learner, it taught me most of my essential day-to-day computational tools. As an Instructor, it changed how I teach, allowing me to reach more students including those that need help the most. As an organiser, it taught me skills that are essential to collaborating and to managing teams.
