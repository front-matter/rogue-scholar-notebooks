It allows you to put predictors on a lot of things. Its power is however not absolute — one thing it doesn’t let you directly do is use data to predict variances of random/varying effects.\n\n\n### [What is LLMLingua?](https://doi.org/10.59350/2k8wt-8kr16)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/2k8wt-8kr16](https://doi.org/10.59350/2k8wt-8kr16)\n<br />Published February 18, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Research Graph<br /><strong>\n The AI Helper Turning Mountains of Data into Bite-Sized Instructions\n</strong>\nAuthor: Aland Astudillo https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8672-3168 LLMs have been changing the way the entire world deals with problems and day-by-day tasks.

We see templates in referee reports and in the text of cookie-cutter research papers. There’s an important insight here:Templates are used in legit academic behaviour as well as in industrial research fraud.\n\n\n### [Mechanistic templates computed for the Grubbs alkene-metathesis reaction.](https://doi.org/10.59350/g2tek-v7c59)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/g2tek-v7c59](https://doi.org/10.59350/g2tek-v7c59)\n<br />Published February 19, 2024 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />Following on from my template exploration of the Wilkinson hydrogenation catalyst, I now repeat this for the Grubbs variant of the Alkene metathesis reaction. As with the Wilkinson, here I focus on the stereochemistry of the mechanism as first suggested by Chauvin[1], an aspect lacking in eg the Wikipedia entry.\n\n\n### [Read and Play Digital Music (MIDI) in R using the *fluidsynth* package](https://doi.org/10.59350/x436c-7vr38)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/x436c-7vr38](https://doi.org/10.59350/x436c-7vr38)\n<br />Published February 20, 2024 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Jeroen Ooms<br />A few weeks ago, prof Matt Crump wrote a blog post in which he explores tools to handle MIDI data in R, in preparation for a cognition experiment that involves creating musical stimuli. In the article he ends up using a mix of external command line tools ffmpeg and fluidsynth and a python module.\n\n\n### [Taking Spatial Omics into the Next Dimension](https://doi.org/10.59350/f07m6-3h227)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/f07m6-3h227](https://doi.org/10.59350/f07m6-3h227)\n<br />Published February 20, 2024 in [GigaBlog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/gigablog)<br />Scott Edmunds<br /><em>\n A multitude of papers on novel methods for Spatial Omics are published in a cross-journal series launching today in GigaScience and GigaByte Journals.\n</em>\nSpatial Omics is a new field that is taking large-scale data-rich biological and biomedical research into new dimensions.

This is billed as:  The goal is to build a citation database between scholarly articles and data, such as datasets in repositories, sequences in GenBank, protein structures in PDB, etc. Access to the corpus can be obtained by submitting a form, then having a (very pleasant) conversation with DataCite about the nature of the corpus.\n\n\n### [commonmeta-py now supports metadata lists](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40)\n<br />Published February 20, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />This week the commonmeta-py Python library adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this feature commonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly work (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post), but can handle lists of scholarly works.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
