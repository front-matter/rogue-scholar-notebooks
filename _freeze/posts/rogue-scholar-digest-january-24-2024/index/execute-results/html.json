This was a reminder that registering a science blog with the Rogue Scholar science blog archive should be quick and painless. Today I made one change that hopefully simplifies registration: Ask for the blog homepage instead of the RSS feed URL.\n\n\n\n### [Toward open research information - Introducing the Information &amp; Openness focal area at CWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts)\nPublished January 18, 2024 in [Leiden Madtrics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/leidenmadtrics)<br />Leiden Madtrics<br />The Information &amp; Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes openness of research information. In this blog post, we present our agenda for the coming five years.\n\n\n\n### [Diamond Open Access: Connotations and recent encounters](https://doi.org/10.59350/bb6d7-fee04)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/bb6d7-fee04](https://doi.org/10.59350/bb6d7-fee04)\n<br />Published January 19, 2024 in [Sci:Debug](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/scidebug)<br />Ulrich Herb<br />“Diamond Age” by jurvetson is licensed under CC BY 2.0  This week, I had some encounters with Diamond Open Access that got me thinking, especially about the connotations of “Diamond Open Access”. These include invoice-like payment requests from a Diamond Open Access platform, editors switching their journal from Hybrid to Diamond Open Access, purchase offers for Diamond Open Access journals and the intention of the German Research Foundation DFG\n\n\n\n### [A mechanistic exploration of the Wilkinson hydrogenation catalyst.
