Organizations are big emitters, because they consume, spend, and grow — a lot. All of those economic activities are strongly coupled with emissions. We do our emission assessments because that information is key to taking informed action. Our previous assessments in 2019, 2020, and 2021 already influenced our equipment policy and event policy.\n\n\n\n### [FAIR Data Digest #22](https://doi.org/10.59350/ph09x-ncj11)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/ph09x-ncj11](https://doi.org/10.59350/ph09x-ncj11)\n<br />Published November 28, 2023 in [FAIR Data Digest](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/fairdata)<br />Sven Lieber<br />How I solved data integration performance problems by rewriting SPARQL queries or changing the approach.
