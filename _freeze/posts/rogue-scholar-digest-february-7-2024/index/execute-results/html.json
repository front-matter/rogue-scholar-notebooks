While preprints have gained popularity, an important consideration is ensuring their scientific quality. This prompted the development of platforms where researchers can comment on, evaluate, and review preprints.\n\n\n### [New Vinyl-only Session: En el mundo de afuera (todo cambia)](https://doi.org/10.59350/7p62q-g0778)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/7p62q-g0778](https://doi.org/10.59350/7p62q-g0778)\n<br />Published February 1, 2024 in [Everything is Connected](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ernestopriego)<br />Ernesto Priego<br />“En el mundo de afuera todo cambia”   – Guadalupe Dueñas, 1958  “El cuatrapeo es parte de la improvisación; la improvisación es parte del selector”.  -Arturo Villamil, 2024, friend and fellow collector and DJ   It’s finally February!\n\n\n### [The UNESCO Open Science Outlook: there is progress, but it is unequal](https://doi.org/10.59350/91td8-0bv95)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/91td8-0bv95](https://doi.org/10.59350/91td8-0bv95)\n<br />Published February 1, 2024 in [Leiden Madtrics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/leidenmadtrics)<br />Ismael Rafols<br /><strong>\n <strong>\n  A value-led perspective on Open Science\n </strong>\n</strong>\nIn 2021, UNESCO approved its Recommendation on Open Science (OS).

The GigaScience Press team are regular attendees of the meeting (see last years write-up), and this year members of our Editorial and Curation teams joined nearly 3000 delegates from over 60 countries.\n\n\n### [Three new userscripts for Wikidata](https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307](https://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307)\n<br />Published February 2, 2024 in [Syntaxus baccata](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/syntaxus_baccata)<br />Lars Willighagen<br />Today I worked on three user scripts for Wikidata. Together, these tools hopefully make the data in Wikidata more accessible and make it easier to navigate between items. To enable these, include one or more of the following lines in your common.js (depending on which script(s) you want): mw.loader.load('//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lagewi/properties.js&amp;oldid=2039401177&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript');\n\n\n### [Using Nextcloud as project management system](https://doi.org/10.59350/m1pc3-3jb42)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/m1pc3-3jb42](https://doi.org/10.59350/m1pc3-3jb42)\n<br />Published February 3, 2024 in [Posts | Prof. Dr. Marco Kalz](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/kalz)<br />Marco Kalz<br />Due to lack of good open source project management systems and deficiencies of federal solutions and lack of a local system, I have explored again Nextcloud as an open source option for project management. While an initial search mostly delivers integrations to Open Project into Nextcloud, I had the goal to model a workflow of a project fully in Nextcloud.\n\n\n### [Scholarly blogging, now with DOIs](https://doi.org/10.59350/s8kvg-9nx69)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/s8kvg-9nx69](https://doi.org/10.59350/s8kvg-9nx69)\n<br />Published February 5, 2024 in [The Ideophone](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ideophone)<br />Mark Dingemanse<br />I have been blogging at\n<em>\n The Ideophone\n</em>\nsince 2007, and not all of it has been as ephemeral as my PhD promotor once feared. My short post documenting the etymology of Zotero is apparently the only scientific documentation of where Zotero’s name comes from; it has served as a source in Wikipedia for ages and has received over 15 scholarly citations.\n\n\n### [New version of commonmeta-py library for scholarly metadata](https://doi.org/10.53731/918y1-v4d08)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/918y1-v4d08](https://doi.org/10.53731/918y1-v4d08)\n<br />Published February 5, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />Yesterday I released version 0.13 of the commonmeta-py library on PyPi. The major new feature is a command-line interface for all metadata conversions, and the metadata validation with the Commonmeta JSON Schema has finally been fixed. The command-line interface takes any supported persistent identifier or file as input, and returns the metadata in the desired format as output.\n\n\n### [Please Shut Up!
