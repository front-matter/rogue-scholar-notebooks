Advisory Board members come from different scholarly disciplines and geographic regions, write in several languages besides English, and have different levels of technical expertise.\n\n\n### [Announcing Rogue Scholar Preview](https://doi.org/10.53731/xwxf3-92j40)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/xwxf3-92j40](https://doi.org/10.53731/xwxf3-92j40)\n<br />Published February 12, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />Today the Rogue Scholar science blog archive launched a new feature:\n<strong>\n Rogue Scholar Preview\n</strong>\n. This new functionality enables the import of new science blogs into the preview version of the production service, located at https://preview.rogue-scholar.org. This allows users to see how their blog posts will look like in the Rogue Scholar service, and to resolve issues if necessary.\n\n\n### [How to use GROBID](https://doi.org/10.59350/hz1er-vrh59)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/hz1er-vrh59](https://doi.org/10.59350/hz1er-vrh59)\n<br />Published February 12, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Research Graph<br /><strong>\n How to use GROBID to extract text from PDF\n</strong>\nAuthor: Aland Astudillo https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8672-3168 GROBID is a powerful and useful tool based on machine learning that can extract text information from PDF files and other files to a structured format. One of the key challenges in knowledge mining from academic articles is reading the content of PDF files.\n\n\n### [INFORMATE: When Are the Data?](https://doi.org/10.54900/08pke-hyy45)\n[https://doi.org/10.54900/08pke-hyy45](https://doi.org/10.54900/08pke-hyy45)\n<br />Published February 13, 2024 in [Upstream](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/upstream)<br />Ted Habermann, Jamaica Jones, Howard Ratner, Tara Packer<br />In a recent Upstream blog post we explored where data connected to papers funded by several U.S. Federal Agencies are published. Different data sharing practices across these agencies led to very different distributions of datasets across various repositories. We used CHORUS reports that combine linked article and dataset metadata as input for that work.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
