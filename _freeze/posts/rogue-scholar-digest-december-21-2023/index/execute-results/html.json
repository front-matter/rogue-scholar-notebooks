A variety of factors inspired this, not least my health and wanting to be able to work from home. After a year, I have reflected on my experience of transferring to a very good employer outside of academia. If you did the same, your mileage might vary, because it all depends where you end up working and for whom.\n\n\n\n### [Call for Submissions. Graphic Biographical Fiction (Deadline: 31 August 2024).

Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\n\n### [CWTS at EASST-4S in Amsterdam](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cwts-at-easst-4s-in-amsterdamamsterdam)\nPublished December 14, 2023 in [Leiden Madtrics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/leidenmadtrics)<br />Leiden Madtrics<br />The next EASST-4S conference will take place in Amsterdam in July 2024.

A firm like BBN winning the main portion of the ARPAnet project was a pivotal reason the ARPAnet project went so smoothly.\n\n\n\n### [Response Letter](https://doi.org/10.59350/k6x1f-hrx26)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/k6x1f-hrx26](https://doi.org/10.59350/k6x1f-hrx26)\n<br />Published December 15, 2023 in [I.D.E.A.S.](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ideas)<br />Tejas S. Sathe<br />Recently, Drs. Robert Wachter and Erik Brynjolfsson published a viewpoint in the Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA on Generative AI in healthcare.
