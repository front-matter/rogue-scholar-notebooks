While there are lots of approaches for classifying publications, most of these approaches lack transparency.\n\n\n### [JOSSCast #2: Astronomy in the Open ‚Äì Dr. Taylor James Bell on Eureka!](https://doi.org/10.59349/hg16v-pxx10)\n[https://doi.org/10.59349/hg16v-pxx10](https://doi.org/10.59349/hg16v-pxx10)\n<br />Published January 25, 2024 in [Journal of Open Source Software Blog |](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/joss)<br />Arfon M.

With large amounts of data, it sometimes becomes difficult to draw insights from it.

By asking for the homepage URL of the blog instead of the feed URL, I hope to make it easier for users to register their blog. At the same time, I fixed a bug in the submission form, caused by an issue with the database backend. Unfortunately, that bug fix didn't work as expected.\n\n\n### [The Macintosh computer at 40.](https://doi.org/10.59350/f11dr-93t29)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/f11dr-93t29](https://doi.org/10.59350/f11dr-93t29)\n<br />Published January 25, 2024 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />On 24th January 1984, the Macintosh computer was released, as all  the media are informing us. Apparently, some are still working. I thought I would give my own personal recollections of that period. In fact, the Mac reached UK stores via a dealership only in 1985.\n\n\n### [Commonmeta adds DataCite schema 4.5 support](https://doi.org/10.53731/293b8-kbq75)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/293b8-kbq75](https://doi.org/10.53731/293b8-kbq75)\n<br />Published January 26, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />On Wednesday DataCite released version 4.5 of the DataCite metadata schema.

This week I want to report on an updated strategy for Rogue Scholar, and what it means for science blogs participating in Rogue Scholar. In August¬†I launched a Mastodon instance at¬†Rogue Scholar Social¬†that accepted Science Blog bots as accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing summaries of blog posts via Rogue Scholar.\n\n\n### [Open sourcing the news](https://doi.org/10.59350/1fv7c-7c536)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/1fv7c-7c536](https://doi.org/10.59350/1fv7c-7c536)\n<br />Published January 30, 2024 in [Chris Hartgerink](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chjh)<br />Chris Hartgerink<br />I read a lot of news, but I do not like being consumed by it. The balance between what's happening now (news), the short or long past (history), and potential futures (foresight or analysis) is a rough one to keep. This post is about making sure that sources are readily accessible where possible, straight from the news. Part of not becoming consumed by the news and its biases is doing source research and verifying information.\n\n\n### [Looking back to look ahead: OpenCitations‚Äô achievements in 2023](https://doi.org/10.59350/2v9xz-dxv31)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/2v9xz-dxv31](https://doi.org/10.59350/2v9xz-dxv31)\n<br />Published January 30, 2024 in [OpenCitations blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/opencitations)<br />Chiara Di Giambattista<br />The first month of the new year has almost come to an end, and we at OpenCitations have dedicated these weeks after the holiday season to retrace the progress we reached as an open infrastructure throughout 2023, an activity that has become a tradition in the past few years.\n\n\n### [Opening up the CWTS Leiden Ranking: Toward a decentralized and open model for data curation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation)\nPublished January 30, 2024 in [Leiden Madtrics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/leidenmadtrics)<br />Leiden Madtrics<br />Today, CWTS released the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking.\n\n\n### [Introducing the Leiden Ranking Open Edition](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition)\nPublished January 30, 2024 in [Leiden Madtrics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/leidenmadtrics)<br />Leiden Madtrics<br />This post introduces the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking, published today by CWTS in collaboration with the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, Sesame Open Science, and OurResearch.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
