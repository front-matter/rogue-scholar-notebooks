Can you make a build in one step?\n\n\n### [rOpenSci Champions Pilot Year: Projects Wrap-Up](https://doi.org/10.59350/268cb-p0021)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/268cb-p0021](https://doi.org/10.59350/268cb-p0021)\n<br />Published March 20, 2024 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Yanina Bellini Saibene<br />Our first cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program has now completed the second phase of the program by developing their project and carrying out outreach activities.\n\n\n### [The FAIR for Research Software Principles after two years: an adoption update](https://doi.org/10.59350/h5fvg-sfh38)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/h5fvg-sfh38](https://doi.org/10.59350/h5fvg-sfh38)\n<br />Published March 20, 2024 in [Research Software Alliance](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchsoft)<br />Michelle Barker, Leyla Jael Castro, Bernadette Fritzsch, Daniel S.

Since the days of the very first scientific journals in the 1650s, the medium had been firmly rooted in paper. Even printed colour only became common (and affordable) from the 1980s. An opportunity to move away from these restrictions was provided by the Web.\n\n\n### [The (potential) impact of AI on the individual research process and  science in general](https://elephantinthelab.org/the-potential-impact-of-ai-on-the-individual-research-process-and-science-in-general)\nPublished March 22, 2024 in [Elephant in the Lab](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/elephantinthelab)<br />Sascha Schönig<br /><em>\n <strong>\n  AI has the potential to change research.
