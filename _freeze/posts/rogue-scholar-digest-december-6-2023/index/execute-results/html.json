The rOpenSci Champions Program is a unique opportunity for us to identify, recognize, and reward such individuals and support them in their work to improve their communities and the wider ecosystem.\n\n\n\n### [The Imperative of Reforming Scientific Publishing](https://doi.org/10.54900/77seh-89t57)\n[https://doi.org/10.54900/77seh-89t57](https://doi.org/10.54900/77seh-89t57)\n<br />Published November 29, 2023 in [Upstream](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/upstream)<br />Moumita Koley, Megha Sud<br /><em>\n The International Science Council is a non-government organization that brings together 45 international scientific Unions and Associations, over 140 national and regional scientific organizations, including Academies and Research Councils, 60 international Federations and Societies, and Young Academies and Associations.\n</em>\n<em>\n The ISC is charting a path toward the mission to advance human development within sustainable planetary and\n</em>\n\n\n\n### [ISC23 Project Poster: SCALABLE: Scalable Lattice-Boltzmann Leaps to Exascale](https://doi.org/10.34732/xdvblg-eg9gxx)\n[https://doi.org/10.34732/xdvblg-eg9gxx](https://doi.org/10.34732/xdvblg-eg9gxx)\n<br />Published November 29, 2023 in [JSC Accelerating Devices Lab](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/x_dev)<br />Jayesh Badwaik<br />At the ISC High Performance Conference 2023  a little while ago, we presented a project poster on the SCALABLE project.

Many of the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL staff. As has been observed, public services can be a relatively easy target.\n\n\n\n### [Single-segment neck muscles in diplodocids?](https://doi.org/10.59350/9z7rj-wee37)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/9z7rj-wee37](https://doi.org/10.59350/9z7rj-wee37)\n<br />Published November 30, 2023 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Matt Wedel<br />I don’t remember now when I first noticed bifurcated cervical ribs in apatosaurines.

This post below, however, puts the tiger in the tank, as it was enhanced by CatGPT:  Maybe scholarly societies have taken “the instruction”follow the money!” a tad too literally?\n\n\n\n### [How many learned societies publish Diamond Open Access journals?](https://doi.org/10.59350/b66bh-pkd46)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/b66bh-pkd46](https://doi.org/10.59350/b66bh-pkd46)\n<br />Published December 1, 2023 in [A blog by Ross Mounce](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rossmounce)<br />Ross Mounce<br />To seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data on open access journals. My first port of call was the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn’t a complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in ‘The OA Diamond Journals Study‘ (2021), it will at least help provide a minimum bound answer to the question.\n\n\n\n### [Bitter Lessons in Chemistry](https://doi.org/10.59350/tkq4r-55311)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/tkq4r-55311](https://doi.org/10.59350/tkq4r-55311)\n<br />Published December 1, 2023 in [Corin Wagen](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/cwagen)<br />Corin Wagen<br />“And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.” –Revelation 10:10 As machine learning becomes more and more important to chemistry, it’s worth reflecting on Richard Sutton’s 2019 blog post about the “bitter lesson.” In\n\n\n\n### [Prediction vs Accommodation: Which is Better and When?](https://doi.org/10.59350/dzs01-6b484)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/dzs01-6b484](https://doi.org/10.59350/dzs01-6b484)\n<br />Published December 4, 2023 in [Critical Metascience](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/markrubin)<br />Mark Rubin<br />In a recent article published in Synthese, philosopher of science Pekka Syrjänen asks “does a theory become better confirmed if it fits data that was not used in its construction versus if it was specifically designed to fit the data?”\n\n\n\n### [2023 in review: Gigabyte journal coming of age, and more](https://doi.org/10.59350/64kz1-bg169)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/64kz1-bg169](https://doi.org/10.59350/64kz1-bg169)\n<br />Published December 4, 2023 in [GigaBlog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/gigablog)<br />Hans Zauner<br /><strong>\n It’s December, the festive season and the end of  year are approaching fast –  and it’s time for our traditional look back on the past 12 months at\n <em>\n  GigaScience Press\n </em>\n .
