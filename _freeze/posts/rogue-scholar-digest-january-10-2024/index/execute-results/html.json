A requirement is to have input sequences in FASTA format. I found that I needed to get ~600 sequences. I had a list of the relevant Uniprot IDs. Surely getting the sequences for these proteins should be straightforward? Solution   The Uniprot IDs can be converted – using the ID Mapping Tool on the Uniprot website – into any number of other IDs.\n\n\n\n### [Physical Organic Chemistry: Alive or Dead?](https://doi.org/10.59350/5nybg-w2n59)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/5nybg-w2n59](https://doi.org/10.59350/5nybg-w2n59)\n<br />Published January 5, 2024 in [Corin Wagen](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/cwagen)<br />Corin Wagen<br />In Wednesday’s post, I wrote that “traditional physical organic chemistry is barely practiced today,” which attracted some controversy on X. Here are some responses: “POC has evolved in many directions and its concepts are widely used, e.g., in host-guest chem, org syn, materials sci, drug discovery.” -\n\n\n\n### [LAIR - Language As Intermediate Representation](https://doi.org/10.59350/qg7b3-crs97)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/qg7b3-crs97](https://doi.org/10.59350/qg7b3-crs97)\n<br />Published January 6, 2024 in [Chris von Csefalvay](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chrisvoncsefalvay)<br />Chris von Csefalvay<br />The awesome thing about language is that, well, we all mostly speak it, to some extent or another. This gives us an immensely powerful tool to manipulate transformational tasks. For the purposes of this post, I consider a transformational task to be essentially anything that takes an input and is largel intended to return some version of the same thing. This is not a very precise definition, but it will have to do for now.\n\n\n\n### [Every Rogue Scholar blog post now available in Markdown, ePub, and PDF formats](https://doi.org/10.53731/1dfxr-hs665)\n[https://doi.org/10.53731/1dfxr-hs665](https://doi.org/10.53731/1dfxr-hs665)\n<br />Published January 8, 2024 in [Front Matter](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/front_matter)<br />Martin Fenner<br />The Rogue Scholar science blog archive starts 2024 with an important release: all blog posts (more than 13,000) are now available for download in Markdown, ePub, and PDF formats. This builds on work completed in December to store the full text of every Rogue Scholar blog post in Markdown format in the Rogue Scholar backend. Combined with the metadata in YAML format, these posts can now be downloaded via the Rogue Scholar API, e.g.\n\n\n\n### [Return to (and of?) the ecology blogosphere](https://doi.org/10.59350/ftfvp-2yp03)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/ftfvp-2yp03](https://doi.org/10.59350/ftfvp-2yp03)\n<br />Published January 8, 2024 in [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/jabberwocky_ecology)<br />Ethan White<br />We started Jabberwocky Ecology back in 2008 when blogs were becoming the dominant medium for informal (online) academic discussions.\n\n\n\n### [Macrocyclic peptide antibiotics &#8211; now Zosurabalpin &#8211; then  antibacterial  agents based on cyclic D,L-α-peptide architectures.](https://doi.org/10.59350/fadrq-1x843)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/fadrq-1x843](https://doi.org/10.59350/fadrq-1x843)\n<br />Published January 8, 2024 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />Zosurabalbin[1],[2], is receiving a great deal of attention as a new class of antibiotic which can target infections for which current treatment options are inadequate.\n\n\n\n### [Papers for MD9A8 – 2024 edition](https://doi.org/10.59350/wzzny-4hm48)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/wzzny-4hm48](https://doi.org/10.59350/wzzny-4hm48)\n<br />Published January 8, 2024 in [quantixed](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/quantixed)<br />Stephen Royle<br />It is time for my annual post of the papers I selected for a module that I teach (MD9A8, the module formerly known as MD997).

While this sounds somewhat insane -- the resulting file is 900GB -- it's quite a cool project for, say, embedded systems work in situations where no internet connection is available. It also provides speedy local indexed lookups, working faster than the internet-dependent API ever could.\n\n\n\n### [It really is the return of the ecology blogosphere!](https://doi.org/10.59350/abmvx-e2989)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/abmvx-e2989](https://doi.org/10.59350/abmvx-e2989)\n<br />Published January 9, 2024 in [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/jabberwocky_ecology)<br />Ethan White<br />After posting yesterday that we were ramping up the blog again, my RSS feed let me know that arguably the most impactful ecology blog of all time, Dynamic Ecology, was doing the same thing!\n\n\n\n### [Regime Shift Cometh?](https://doi.org/10.59350/7bkhw-q2y44)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/7bkhw-q2y44](https://doi.org/10.59350/7bkhw-q2y44)\n<br />Published January 9, 2024 in [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/jabberwocky_ecology)<br />Morgan Ernest<br />We’ve been studying how rodent communities change through time in the Arizona desert for 40 years.
