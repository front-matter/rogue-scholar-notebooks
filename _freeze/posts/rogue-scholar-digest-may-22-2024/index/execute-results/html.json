Well, here are two, the first being the topic of a recent article[1]. The second is a favourite of organic chemistry tutors, to see if their students recognise it as an unusual (= impossible) form of a much better known molecule. Perhaps we could define impossible molecules into two slightly different classes.\n\n\n### [Communication Tips for your Open-Source Project](https://doi.org/10.59350/8sqxt-7zp92)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/8sqxt-7zp92](https://doi.org/10.59350/8sqxt-7zp92)\n<br />Published May 17, 2024 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Maëlle Salmon<br />Do you maintain an open-source project like an R package or a collection thereof, and wonder how to best use various communication channels to inform and engage with your community of users?We’ve consolidated this list of tips.Some of them are required in our opinion, others are simply nice to have.Required: Having good release notes  Since you’re developing a product, the first act of communication is to write informative release notes.Release\n\n\n### [CompactifAI: Large Language Models Don’t Actually Have To Be Large](https://doi.org/10.59350/mn7pe-zhx56)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/mn7pe-zhx56](https://doi.org/10.59350/mn7pe-zhx56)\n<br />Published May 17, 2024 in [Stories by Research Graph on Medium](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/researchgraph)<br />Amanda Kau<br /><strong>\n A novel compression technique ensuring comparable performance with 70% less parameters\n</strong>\nAuthor  Amanda Kau (\n<strong>\n ORCID\n</strong>\n: 0009–0004–4949–9284) Introduction   The sizes of large language models (LLMs) have been steadily increasing over the last few years.\n\n\n### [New re3data.org Editorial Board Members](https://doi.org/10.59350/vwqhx-11h18)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/vwqhx-11h18](https://doi.org/10.59350/vwqhx-11h18)\n<br />Published May 17, 2024 in [re3data COREF Project Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/coref)<br />re3data Team<br />The re3data Editorial Board is pleased to welcome seven new members: Dalal Hakim Rahme, Coordinator of Content Curation, United Nations Rene Faustino Gabriel Junior, Professor, Universidade Federal do Rio Grando do Sul Sandra Gisela Martín, Library Director, Universidad Católica de Córdoba Tekleweyni Geday, Lecturer, Mekelle University Theodora Bloom, Executive Editor, BMJ Vaidas Morkevičius, Professor, Lithuanian Data Archive for Social\n\n\n### [cdk2024 #2: publishing grant proposals](https://doi.org/10.59350/s1hwk-vj154)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/s1hwk-vj154](https://doi.org/10.59350/s1hwk-vj154)\n<br />Published May 18, 2024 in [chem-bla-ics](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chem_bla_ics)<br />Egon Willighagen<br />Publishing grant proposal is still not very common. The proposal published in Research Ideas and Outcomes) (doi:10.3897/rio.10.e124884) for the NWO Open Science grant for the CDK is, however, not the first and hopefully not the last. Interestingly, it is already cited in (the German) Wikipedia.

We’ve seen before that making something usefully findable requires deep indexing, and already that continues to be difficult, because we are not seeing it enough. So, when I thought convert a paper led by Hoet’s lab in Leuven into machine-actionable RDF to make it FAIR, I gravely underestimated the amount of work.\n\n\n### [Possible  Formation of an Impossible Molecule?](https://doi.org/10.59350/ffqc4-bvs29)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/ffqc4-bvs29](https://doi.org/10.59350/ffqc4-bvs29)\n<br />Published May 20, 2024 in [Henry Rzepa's Blog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rzepa)<br />Henry Rzepa<br />In the previous post, I explored the so-called “impossible” molecule methanetriol. It is regarded as such because the equilbrium resulting in loss of water is very facile, being exoenergic by ~14 kcal/mol in free energy. Here I explore whether changing the substituent R could result in suppressing the loss of water and stabilising the triol.\n\n\n### [Publishing Citizen Science Data: Q&amp;A with the Hong Kong Jellyfish Project](https://doi.org/10.59350/43bf4-rrd87)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/43bf4-rrd87](https://doi.org/10.59350/43bf4-rrd87)\n<br />Published May 20, 2024 in [GigaBlog](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/gigablog)<br />Scott Edmunds<br /><em>\n Today we publish a new Data Release presenting a dataset of jellyfish sightings collected by citizen scientists from 2021 through 2023 within Hong Kong waters.
