A variety of factors inspired this, not least my health and wanting to be able to work from home. After a year, I have reflected on my experience of transferring to a very good employer outside of academia. If you did the same, your mileage might vary, because it all depends where you end up working and for whom.\n\n\nCall for Submissions. Graphic Biographical Fiction (Deadline: 31 August 2024).

Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\nCWTS at EASST-4S in Amsterdam\nPublished December 14, 2023 in Leiden MadtricsLeiden MadtricsThe next EASST-4S conference will take place in Amsterdam in July 2024.

Today’s piece dives into the history of BBN and the firm’s unique structure.

User requests wanted\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/n29ak-pmk26 Published February 19, 2024 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceMike Mahoney, Maëlle SalmonThe package waywiser maintained by Mike Mahoney provides ergonomic methods for assessing spatial models.Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging,both because these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the original region represented by training data and due to potential spatially structured errors,with “hot spots” of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the\n\n\nThank you for your warm work… earnestly\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/7yhmz-8sx36 Published February 19, 2024 in Stories by Adam Day on MediumAdam DaySo, we’ve established that papermills like to use templates. We see templates in referee reports and in the text of cookie-cutter research papers. There’s an important insight here:Templates are used in legit academic behaviour as well as in industrial research fraud.\n\n\nMechanistic templates computed for the Grubbs alkene-metathesis reaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/g2tek-v7c59 Published February 19, 2024 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaFollowing on from my template exploration of the Wilkinson hydrogenation catalyst, I now repeat this for the Grubbs variant of the Alkene metathesis reaction. As with the Wilkinson, here I focus on the stereochemistry of the mechanism as first suggested by Chauvin[1], an aspect lacking in eg the Wikipedia entry.\n\n\nRead and Play Digital Music (MIDI) in R using the fluidsynth package\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/x436c-7vr38 Published February 20, 2024 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceJeroen OomsA few weeks ago, prof Matt Crump wrote a blog post in which he explores tools to handle MIDI data in R, in preparation for a cognition experiment that involves creating musical stimuli. In the article he ends up using a mix of external command line tools ffmpeg and fluidsynth and a python module.\n\n\nTaking Spatial Omics into the Next Dimension\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/f07m6-3h227 Published February 20, 2024 in GigaBlogScott Edmunds A multitude of papers on novel methods for Spatial Omics are published in a cross-journal series launching today in GigaScience and GigaByte Journals.  Spatial Omics is a new field that is taking large-scale data-rich biological and biomedical research into new dimensions. Which is having a significant impact on the fundamental fields of biology and biomedicine.\n\n\nProblems with the DataCite Data Citation Corpus\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/t80g1-xys37 Published February 20, 2024 in iPhyloRoderic PageDataCite have released the Data Citation Corpus, together with a dashboard that summarises the corpus. This is billed as: The goal is to build a citation database between scholarly articles and data, such as datasets in repositories, sequences in GenBank, protein structures in PDB, etc. Access to the corpus can be obtained by submitting a form, then having a (very pleasant) conversation with DataCite about the nature of the corpus.\n\n\ncommonmeta-py now supports metadata lists\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40 Published February 20, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerThis week the commonmeta-py Python library adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this feature commonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly work (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post), but can handle lists of scholarly works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Epistemic security has to do with things like the spreading of misinformation on social media. I.e. if we spend enough time on social media reading unreliable information, how does that influence us? That’s a matter of epistemic security. Epistemic security is interesting because if you start a conversation about epistemic security at a party, they don’t invite you back.\n\n\nEvery Rogue Scholar blog post now also available in JATS XML format\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/3w1ye-q6z42 Published January 10, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerOn Monday the Rogue Scholar science blog archive added support for exporting the blog posts in various formats: markdown, ePub, and PDF.

Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\nThe speed (or lack thereof) of science\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/nktxq-g6v29 Published January 11, 2024 in bjoern.brembs.blogBjörn BrembsIt was my freshman year, 1991. I was enthusiastic to finally be learning about biology, after being forced to waste a year in the German army’s compulsory service at the time. Little did I know that it was the same year a research paper was published that would guide the direction of my career to this day, more than 30 years later. Many of the links in this post will go to old web pages I created while learning about this research.\n\n\nrOpenSci 2023 Code of Conduct Transparency Report\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/k1t8d-pem58 Published January 12, 2024 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceYanina Bellini Saibene, Mark Padgham, Kara WooThe rOpenSci community is supported by our Code of Conduct with a clear description of unacceptable behaviors,instructions on how to make a report, and information on how reports are handled.

Although this is in some respects a minor paper, I’m fond of it because it fell into place so quickly and easily.\n\n\nScholarly journals vs Scholarly Blogs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/yt66x-pe726 Published January 12, 2024 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaFirst, a very brief history of scholarly publishing, starting in 1665[1] when scientific journals started to be published by learned societies. This model continued until the 1950s, when commercial publishers such as Pergamon Press started with their USP (unique selling point) of rapid time to publication of ~3 months,[2] compared to typical times for many learned society publishers of 2 years or longer.\n\n\nImproved PDF-formatted Rogue Scholar blog posts\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/mndd9-1d509 Published January 12, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerOn Monday the Rogue Scholar science blog archive launched the export of blog posts in PDF and other formats.

If I had known back at the start of my diagnosis what I know now, I do not know for sure that things would be very different, but there was a heck of a lot I did not know. How complex is this disease and the things it does? This complex: “Rheumatoid arthritis” sounds like the sort of disease that old people get that isn’t very serious.\n\n\nScopus: caught-out and shirking responsibility\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/dc6zg-vk273 Published January 14, 2024 in A blog by Ross MounceRoss MounceIn December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in  Science  magazine [1], that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication scams whereby authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have their work published on a website that looks like a real scholarly journal but is in fact not a proper journal, merely an impersonation of one.\n\n\nHow to Update a Translation with Babeldown\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/3w9fd-8d411 Published January 16, 2024 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceMaëlle SalmonAs part of rOpenSci’s multilingual publishing project  1  , we have been developing the babeldown R package, for translating Markdown-based content using the DeepL API.\n\n\nStarting at data.org\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/5a08g-z5214 Published January 16, 2024 in Chris HartgerinkChris HartgerinkIn October, I shared I started to look for a regular job — last week, I started as a senior software engineer for data.org until end of 2025. In this role, I will be contributing to digital public goods using data for social impact.\n\n\nNeed for Consistent and Uniform Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI-generated Scholarly Content\nhttps://doi.org/10.54900/sdgvx-tty28 Published January 16, 2024 in UpstreamUttkarsha Bhosale, Gayatri Phadke, Anupama KapadiaAs we witness the ever-evolving landscape of technology, we realize that artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword anymore; it’s a reality that is already leading to transformation in how scholarly research is published and disseminated.\n\n\nImproving Rogue Scholar metadata conversions\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08 Published January 16, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerLast week the Rogue Scholar science blog archive added export of blog post content in various formats (Markdown, ePub, PDF, JATS XML).

As a learner, it taught me most of my essential day-to-day computational tools. As an Instructor, it changed how I teach, allowing me to reach more students including those that need help the most. As an organiser, it taught me skills that are essential to collaborating and to managing teams. As a creator, it taught me how to hand off the work to the next leg in the never-ending relay race.\n\n\nUnderstanding Misinformation and Science in Societal Debates\nPublished January 16, 2024 in Leiden MadtricsLeiden MadtricsIn a new research project, we explore the interaction between misinformation and science on social media during COVID-19. This is part of the new research line on the role of science in societal debates of our Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.

It’s hard to describe what the hell exactly one needs to be on to enjoy it, but think of it like the aesthetic from the latter Fallout games with a more optimistic outlook on the future. Gibson described it as “the future that never was”, and I think that’s a pretty apt description. The future we were all promised, in all its Raygun Gothic glory.\n\n\nAll The Right Friends II: clustering papers using Google Scholar data\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/6gpp6-ffv59\nPublished October 29, 2023 in quantixed\nStephen Royle\nIn a previous post, I looked at how Google Scholar ranks co-authors.

With large amounts of data, it sometimes becomes difficult to draw insights from it. This blog article examines how to combine Neo4j, a graph database, with OpenAI’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to build a robust knowledge management system.\n\n\nAdding automated end-to-end testing to Rogue Scholar\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/bxgh0-dhj87 Published January 25, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerLast week I reported a small change to the Rogue Scholar science blog submission form. By asking for the homepage URL of the blog instead of the feed URL, I hope to make it easier for users to register their blog. At the same time, I fixed a bug in the submission form, caused by an issue with the database backend. Unfortunately, that bug fix didn’t work as expected.\n\n\nThe Macintosh computer at 40.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/f11dr-93t29 Published January 25, 2024 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaOn 24th January 1984, the Macintosh computer was released, as all the media are informing us. Apparently, some are still working. I thought I would give my own personal recollections of that period. In fact, the Mac reached UK stores via a dealership only in 1985.\n\n\nCommonmeta adds DataCite schema 4.5 support\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/293b8-kbq75 Published January 26, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerOn Wednesday DataCite released version 4.5 of the DataCite metadata schema. Today I released updated versions of the commonmeta Ruby and Python libraries that fully support the new schema. You can install them via Rubygems and PyPI, respectively.\n\n\nThings I am still wondering about generative AI + Search in 2024 - impact of semantic search, generation of answers with citations and more..\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/vh0zy-9k287 Published January 26, 2024 in Aaron Tay’s Musings about librarianshipAaron Tay Earlier related pieces - How Q&A systems based on large language models (eg GPT4) will change things if they become the dominant search paradigm - 9 implications for libraries  In the ever-evolving landscape of information retrieval and library science, the emergence of large language models, particularly those based on the transformer architecture like GPT-4, has opened up a Pandora’s box of possibilities and challenges.\n\n\nLessons Answer.AI can learn from history’s greatest R&D labs\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/tc7xn-gnn19 Published January 26, 2024 in FreakTakesEric GilliamToday’s piece was put together with the help of several conversations with Answer.AI co-founder Jeremy Howard. It is not a “traditional” FreakTakes piece; the research and advice are much more tailored to a specific group of individuals than usual.\n\n\n3D Molecular model visualisation: 3 Million atoms +\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/d20n9-rbx62 Published January 27, 2024 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaIn the late 1980s, as I recollected here[1] the equipment needed for real time molecular visualisation as it became known as was still expensive, requiring custom systems such as Evans and Sutherland PS390 workstations.\n\n\nGrab-bag post: Parapropalaehoplophorus, a favorite book, Tate 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/j5jfg-n3k62 Published January 29, 2024 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMatt Wedel  Eoneophron  ,  Parapropalaehoplophorus  ,  Ia io  , and friends  The other day Mike wrote to me about the new Hell Creek oviraptorosaur  Eoneophron  (Atkins-Weltman et al. 2024), commenting that he liked the ‘eoneo’ — old new — part of the name. That sent me down a little etymological rabbit hole.\n\n\nAn update on Rogue Scholar in the fediverse\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/dnfg0-hge29 Published January 29, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerThe Rogue Scholar science blogging archive joined the fediverse in August of last year. This week I want to report on an updated strategy for Rogue Scholar, and what it means for science blogs participating in Rogue Scholar. In August I launched a Mastodon instance at Rogue Scholar Social that accepted Science Blog bots as accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing summaries of blog posts via Rogue Scholar.\n\n\nOpen sourcing the news\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/1fv7c-7c536 Published January 30, 2024 in Chris HartgerinkChris HartgerinkI read a lot of news, but I do not like being consumed by it. The balance between what’s happening now (news), the short or long past (history), and potential futures (foresight or analysis) is a rough one to keep. This post is about making sure that sources are readily accessible where possible, straight from the news. Part of not becoming consumed by the news and its biases is doing source research and verifying information.\n\n\nLooking back to look ahead: OpenCitations’ achievements in 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/2v9xz-dxv31 Published January 30, 2024 in OpenCitations blogChiara Di GiambattistaThe first month of the new year has almost come to an end, and we at OpenCitations have dedicated these weeks after the holiday season to retrace the progress we reached as an open infrastructure throughout 2023, an activity that has become a tradition in the past few years.\n\n\nOpening up the CWTS Leiden Ranking: Toward a decentralized and open model for data curation\nPublished January 30, 2024 in Leiden MadtricsLeiden MadtricsToday, CWTS released the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking.\n\n\nIntroducing the Leiden Ranking Open Edition\nPublished January 30, 2024 in Leiden MadtricsLeiden MadtricsThis post introduces the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking, published today by CWTS in collaboration with the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, Sesame Open Science, and OurResearch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The GigaScience Press team are regular attendees of the meeting (see last years write-up), and this year members of our Editorial and Curation teams joined nearly 3000 delegates from over 60 countries.\n\n\nThree new userscripts for Wikidata\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/2nwnz-8h307 Published February 2, 2024 in Syntaxus baccataLars WillighagenToday I worked on three user scripts for Wikidata. Together, these tools hopefully make the data in Wikidata more accessible and make it easier to navigate between items. To enable these, include one or more of the following lines in your common.js (depending on which script(s) you want): mw.loader.load(‘//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lagewi/properties.js&oldid=2039401177&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript’);\n\n\nUsing Nextcloud as project management system\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/m1pc3-3jb42 Published February 3, 2024 in Posts | Prof. Dr. Marco KalzMarco KalzDue to lack of good open source project management systems and deficiencies of federal solutions and lack of a local system, I have explored again Nextcloud as an open source option for project management. While an initial search mostly delivers integrations to Open Project into Nextcloud, I had the goal to model a workflow of a project fully in Nextcloud.\n\n\nScholarly blogging, now with DOIs\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/s8kvg-9nx69 Published February 5, 2024 in The IdeophoneMark DingemanseI have been blogging at  The Ideophone  since 2007, and not all of it has been as ephemeral as my PhD promotor once feared. My short post documenting the etymology of Zotero is apparently the only scientific documentation of where Zotero’s name comes from; it has served as a source in Wikipedia for ages and has received over 15 scholarly citations.\n\n\nNew version of commonmeta-py library for scholarly metadata\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/918y1-v4d08 Published February 5, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerYesterday I released version 0.13 of the commonmeta-py library on PyPi. The major new feature is a command-line interface for all metadata conversions, and the metadata validation with the Commonmeta JSON Schema has finally been fixed. The command-line interface takes any supported persistent identifier or file as input, and returns the metadata in the desired format as output.\n\n\nPlease Shut Up!

I loved it. I was doing data engineer stuff there, mostly maintaining infrastructure for data pipelines. Everyone was great and the mission was amazing: helping Democrats win. Yet the company was shut down about a month ago, sending me on another job search, the 3rd since early/mid 2021.\n\n\nJob searching notes\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/x9ts7-g5a56\nPublished October 9, 2023 in recology\nScott Chamberlain\nnotes to self for next job hunt (some of which may be generally useful): don’t apply to general tech companies anymore for many reasons.\n\n\nCall for editors\nhttps://doi.org/10.59349/j47z9-5d536\nPublished October 9, 2023 in Journal of Open Source Software Blog\nArfon M.

Concepts have always been used to occupy the moral high ground. Rebellion, for example, is used to delegitimise those who rebel.\n\n\nOnboarding with confidence in open research (s03e16)\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/wk19c-zqs88\nPublished October 10, 2023 in Liberate Science\nChris Hartgerink\n🔈This is a transcript of the Open Update podcast.

In panel discussions or digital formats, such as blog posts, the current state and future of Open Access are examined.\nThis action week is a good opportunity to take a look at the Rogue Scholar Science Blog Archive (Di Giambattista 2023). A search in the archive of English-language blogs archived by Rogue Scholar yields 493 hits for the term open access week. The same search for German-language blogs resulted in 44 hits (as of October 22, 2023).\nIn the following, I will introduce some of the posts. To do this, I will use the Five Ws method and will present a blog post for each W."

My first port of call was the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn’t a complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in ’The OA Diamond Journals Study‘ (2021), it will at least help provide a minimum bound answer to the question.\n\n\nBitter Lessons in Chemistry\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/tkq4r-55311 Published December 1, 2023 in Corin WagenCorin Wagen“And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it.

Traditionally, this journey involved wading through static pages and search indexes, a process both time-consuming and fraught with uncertainty.\n\n\nBack to class: Reflections from the 2023 CWTS Summer School\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/5c8gk-rt461 Published November 16, 2023 in Scholarly Communications Lab | ScholCommLabOlivia AguiarThe Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) hosted their fifth Scientometrics Summer School (CS  3  ) from September 18-26, 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. CS  3  turns theoretical ideas into hands-on research by engaging scientometrics graduate students with data, methods, and techniques used in the field. ScholCommLab members Chantal Ripp, Maddie Hare, Leigh-Ann Butler, and Rémi Toupin attended this year’s event.\n\n\nTwo thoughts on blogging: thought archives, and bullets dodged\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/29yxb-qh763 Published November 16, 2023 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMatt WedelI haven’t blogged about blogging in a while. Maybe because blogging already feels distinctly old-fashioned in the broader culture. A lot of the active discussion migrated away a long time ago, to Facebook and Twitter, and then to other social media outlets as each one in turn goes over the enshittification event horizon.\n\n\nR-universe now builds WASM binaries for all R packages\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/bkag3-csz91 Published November 17, 2023 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceJeroen OomsAbstract / TLDR R-universe now builds WASM binaries of all R packages for use in WebR applications (such as shinylive). For example to test the dev version of dplyr, you can open the WebR demo page and run:install.packages(‘dplyr’, repos = c(‘https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev’, ‘https://repo.r-wasm.org’)) As explained below, not all R packages are supported yet;\n\n\nKudos to PCI Registered Reports\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170 Published November 19, 2023 in A blog by Ross MounceRoss MounceThis is just a quick post of appreciation for PCI Registered Reports. I’ve recently joined the PCI RR community as a ’recommender‘. One thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was deeply insufficient.\n\n\nPolitical microtargeting\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/3bzex-66903 Published November 20, 2023 in Chris HartgerinkChris HartgerinkInching towards the Dutch elections, increasing amounts of claims are being made about the (micro)targeting of different campaigns. Here are some: New Social Contract does not do any online ads. The Greens-Labour Party spent €323,000 - more than twice as much as the Democrats 66 (D66), who spent €153,000. The Think (Denk) Party is profiling for Turkish ethnicity. The senior 50PLUS party microtargeted on people who listen to Angerfist.\n\n\nEmpowering Open Science: Donate to Support our Mission\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/9den0-fmz94 Published November 21, 2023 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceThe rOpenSci TeamrOpenSci is a nonprofit organization that is funded entirely by grants and donations. These contributions enable us to keep our projects and infrastructure active and accessible to the community. Our projects are dedicated to establishing and upholding both technical and social infrastructure that supports open and reproducible science for all our members.\n\n\nAiry Area: approximating surface area of a cell from a 3D point set\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/frjvg-1nb81 Published November 21, 2023 in quantixedStephen RoyleIn the spirit of “if it took you a while to find out how to do something, write about it”, I will detail a method to approximate the surface area of a 3D shape. Our application here was finding the surface area of a cell but it can be used on any shape. We start with a 3D point set, specified by points of interest in a single cell imaged by 3D confocal microscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

(Photo credit: Noxolo Chalale)  By Anelda Van der Walt (Director, Talarify) 6 December 2023 The African continent is home to some of the world’s most significant multi-country research projects.\n\n\nStochastic parrots, cap and gown edition\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/412q0-sbn89 Published December 6, 2023 in Chris von CsefalvayChris von CsefalvayIt’s not every day that you find out you have climbed the exalted heights of another discipline. My work is pretty interdisciplinary, but it shocked me, too, that I’m apparently holding forth on neoliberalism and the epistemic question in African universities (archive link): Figure 1: Apparently, I’m commenting on neoliberalism in African universities.\n\n\nGoogle’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) is now available in 120+ countres. What you need to know\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/cmexr-nyv90 Published December 7, 2023 in Aaron Tay’s Musings about librarianshipAaron TayNote: This is a lightly edited piece of something I wrote for my institution  What is Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE)?  In past ResearchRadar pieces, we have discussed about how search engines both general (e.g. Bing Chat, Perplexity) and academic (e.g Elicit, Scite Assistant, Scopus (upcoming)) are integrating search with generative AI (via Large Language Models) using techniques like RAG (Retrieval Augmented\n\n\nA trip down memory lane: An online departmental connection map from 1989.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/85xp6-2sy65 Published December 7, 2023 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaIn 2023, we very much take for granted that everyone and pretty much everything is online. But it was not always so and when I came across an old plan indicating how the chemistry department at Imperial College was connected in 1989, I was struck by how much has happened in the 34 years since. Nowadays all the infrastructures needed are effectively “built in” to the building when it is constructed and few are even aware of them.\n\n\nDocumentation, documentation, documentation\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/fgyjr-hg721 Published December 7, 2023 in Front MatterMartin FennerWriting software is more than writing code – good documentation is one essential aspect. A lot of the tools and libraries that make writing documentation easier use markdown as a file format, combined with metadata in yaml format and optionally some additional functionality, e.g. mdx – which combines markdown with jsx for JSX-based projects such as React.\n\n\nMake-or-buy decisions in research and research software\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/6q2e5-hhs87 Published December 7, 2023 in Daniel S. Katz’s blogDaniel S. KatzMake-or-buy decisions are common in business and research. They often involve an analysis of the pros and cons of creating something (e.g., a physical item, software, a service) vs. acquiring it from someone else.\n\n\nHow sauropods increased the size of ventral neck muscles\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/7ppge-gpg13 Published December 8, 2023 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMike TaylorLast time I promised you exciting news about sauropod neck-muscle mass. Let none say that I do not fulfil covenents. And, as usual, when talking about sauropod neck muscle mass, I’m going to start by talking about bird legs. Look at this flamingo: Ridiculous, right? Those legs are like matchsticks. How can they possibly work.\n\n\nBrief thoughts on qualitative and quantitative projects\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/tpx31-qby94 Published December 10, 2023 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMike TaylorBack in the first post about our recent paper on bifurcated cervical ribs in apatosaurines, I noted: I’m fond of this one because it’s pleasingly low-tech and traditional.\n\n\nThe journey from Journal “ESI” to FAIR data objects: An eighteen year old (continuing) experiment.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/g2p77-78m14 Published December 10, 2023 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaAround 1996, journals started publishing what became known as “ESI” or electronic supporting information, alongside the articles themselves, as a mechanism for exposing the data associated with the research being reported and exploiting some of the new opportunities offered by the World Wide Web. From the outset, such ESI was expressed as a paginated Acrobat file, with the Web being merely a convenient document delivery mechanism.\n\n\nType I Error Rates are Not Usually Inflated\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573 Published December 10, 2023 in Critical MetascienceMark RubinThe inflation of Type I error rates is thought to be one of the causes of the replication crisis. Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this new article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\nNo Synths! Use of AI in scientific publications\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/axrsb-4kz33 Published December 10, 2023 in quantixedStephen RoyleBands have been known to declare “No Synths!” on their albums. This statement was a badge of pride indicating that the artists hadn’t used any modern trickery in their recordings. Today, the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in science has created a similar scenario. Advocates argue that these tools improve every aspect of science, including the publication process.\n\n\nHow to create separate bibliographies in a Quarto document\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/5dvez-q6817 Published December 11, 2023 in Andrew Heiss’s blogAndrew Heiss  tl;dr If you want to skip the explanation and justification for why you might want separate bibliographies, you can skip down to the example section, or just go see some example files at GitHub. Why use separate bibliographies? In academic articles, it’s common to have a supplemental appendix with extra tables, figures, robustness checks, additional math, proofs, and other details.\n\n\nArchiving individual science blog posts\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/5vvnh-tnm55 Published December 11, 2023 in Front MatterMartin FennerSometimes we want to preserve a blog post to read or reuse later. There are generic tools for that purpose, including read-it-later apps such as Instapaper or Pocket. For scholarly blog posts, the right place can also be a reference manager, which stores the content and the metadata, especially if a DOI was registered for each blog post. Reference managers can store full-text documents and typically use PDF as the file format.\n\n\nWhat I learned from getting bodied by a robot.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/r8k9q-zdm06 Published December 12, 2023 in Chris von CsefalvayChris von CsefalvaySay you’re busing tables and you’re trying to pass someone in a wheelchair. What do you do? Do you say “excuse me” and wait for them to move? Do you say “excuse me” and then try to pass them? Do you just try to pass them? Do you say nothing and just try to pass them? All of these are, actually, pretty legitimate answers. Now, say you’re a robot.\n\n\nVU Amsterdam supports ResearchEquals\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/tx9hq-akz97 Published December 12, 2023 in Liberate ScienceChris HartgerinkVU Amsterdam is now a supporting member of ResearchEquals, sustaining and governing the development of modular publishing. VU Amsterdam joins as the third institutional supporter, alongside Tilburg University and KU Leuven. VU Amsterdam supports new research initiatives through their VU Open Access Innovation Fund. They support open, free and fair publishing alternatives set up by and for researchers.\n\n\nFAIR Data Digest #23\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/j92en-x6n14 Published December 12, 2023 in FAIR Data DigestSven LieberOpen data of 16.2 million Dutch vehicles that can be used to enrich Wikidata\n\n\nSC23 WHPC Workshop Paper: OpenGPT-X – Novel Architecture Exploration\nhttps://doi.org/10.34732/xdvblg-0xczeh Published December 12, 2023 in JSC Accelerating Devices LabChelsea JohnThe Supercomputing Conference 2023 took place in Denver, Colorado, from November 12th to 17th. For the  Women in HPC  workshop, we submitted a paper, which focused on benchmarking different accelerators for AI. The paper was accepted and I was invited to hold a lightning talk to show the work, spun off our OpenGPT-X project.\n\n\nAbschied von Jenny Delasalle: „What will survive of us is love“\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/7cw3g-fxz50 Published December 12, 2023 in Open Access Blog BerlinMaxi Kindling– English below –Die Nachricht, dass Jenny Delasalle am vergangenen Freitag, den 8. Dezember 2023, nach schwerer Krankheit verstorben ist, haben wir mit großer Betroffenheit gelesen. Für die Open Access Community in Berlin und weit darüber hinaus ist ihr Tod ein großer Verlust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

You can view the structures and energies right in the page, or you can follow a link and view the full data in a new tab.\n\n\nTips from the Blog XVI: getting FASTA sequences\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/57w5w-bk852 Published January 4, 2024 in quantixedStephen RoyleI am having some fun running AlphaPulldown on a computing cluster. A requirement is to have input sequences in FASTA format. I found that I needed to get ~600 sequences. I had a list of the relevant Uniprot IDs. Surely getting the sequences for these proteins should be straightforward? Solution The Uniprot IDs can be converted – using the ID Mapping Tool on the Uniprot website – into any number of other IDs.\n\n\nPhysical Organic Chemistry: Alive or Dead?\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/5nybg-w2n59 Published January 5, 2024 in Corin WagenCorin WagenIn Wednesday’s post, I wrote that “traditional physical organic chemistry is barely practiced today,” which attracted some controversy on X. Here are some responses: “POC has evolved in many directions and its concepts are widely used, e.g., in host-guest chem, org syn, materials sci, drug discovery.” -\n\n\nLAIR - Language As Intermediate Representation\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/qg7b3-crs97 Published January 6, 2024 in Chris von CsefalvayChris von CsefalvayThe awesome thing about language is that, well, we all mostly speak it, to some extent or another. This gives us an immensely powerful tool to manipulate transformational tasks. For the purposes of this post, I consider a transformational task to be essentially anything that takes an input and is largel intended to return some version of the same thing. This is not a very precise definition, but it will have to do for now.\n\n\nEvery Rogue Scholar blog post now available in Markdown, ePub, and PDF formats\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/1dfxr-hs665 Published January 8, 2024 in Front MatterMartin FennerThe Rogue Scholar science blog archive starts 2024 with an important release: all blog posts (more than 13,000) are now available for download in Markdown, ePub, and PDF formats. This builds on work completed in December to store the full text of every Rogue Scholar blog post in Markdown format in the Rogue Scholar backend. Combined with the metadata in YAML format, these posts can now be downloaded via the Rogue Scholar API, e.g.\n\n\nReturn to (and of?) the ecology blogosphere\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/ftfvp-2yp03 Published January 8, 2024 in Jabberwocky EcologyEthan WhiteWe started Jabberwocky Ecology back in 2008 when blogs were becoming the dominant medium for informal (online) academic discussions.\n\n\nMacrocyclic peptide antibiotics – now Zosurabalpin – then antibacterial agents based on cyclic D,L-α-peptide architectures.\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/fadrq-1x843 Published January 8, 2024 in Henry Rzepa’s BlogHenry RzepaZosurabalbin[1],[2], is receiving a great deal of attention as a new class of antibiotic which can target infections for which current treatment options are inadequate.\n\n\nPapers for MD9A8 – 2024 edition\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/wzzny-4hm48 Published January 8, 2024 in quantixedStephen RoyleIt is time for my annual post of the papers I selected for a module that I teach (MD9A8, the module formerly known as MD997). Previous selections are grouped here or here.  The list serves as a snapshot of interesting papers published in the previous 12 months or so.  I hope it is useful to others who are looking for lists of papers to read, for student selections or for anything else.\n\n\nSome sea cucumbers like it hot\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/vf5xp-jfw28 Published January 8, 2024 in GigaBlogHans Zauner We start the new year with news from the deep, published in GigaScience: The genome of a sea cucumber, collected at a depth of 2400 m during a submarine trip to a hydrothermal vent, helps scientists to understand how marine animals can survive in extreme conditions.  Hydrothermal vents are an unlikely environment for animals to flourish.\n\n\nResearch Software Alliance Community Report 2023\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/n4epb-gxm91 Published January 9, 2024 in Research Software AllianceResearch Software AllianceJanuary 2024 This downloadable report features ReSA’s engagement in 2023 with key decision makers and influencers involved with research software across the globe, as well as the broader research software community.

While this sounds somewhat insane – the resulting file is 900GB – it’s quite a cool project for, say, embedded systems work in situations where no internet connection is available. It also provides speedy local indexed lookups, working faster than the internet-dependent API ever could.\n\n\nIt really is the return of the ecology blogosphere!\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/abmvx-e2989 Published January 9, 2024 in Jabberwocky EcologyEthan WhiteAfter posting yesterday that we were ramping up the blog again, my RSS feed let me know that arguably the most impactful ecology blog of all time, Dynamic Ecology, was doing the same thing!\n\n\nRegime Shift Cometh?\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/7bkhw-q2y44 Published January 9, 2024 in Jabberwocky EcologyMorgan ErnestWe’ve been studying how rodent communities change through time in the Arizona desert for 40 years.

    "text": "More examples of “double-headed” curly arrows: S and C Nucleophiles attacking acetyl chloride\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/h7vdj-cky15\nPublished October 12, 2023 in Henry Rzepa’s Blog\nHenry Rzepa\nIn an earlier post on this topic, I described how the curly-arrows describing the mechanism of a nucleophilic addition at a carbonyl group choreograph in two distinct ways, as seen in red or blue below. The arrows in red can be described as firstly addition to the carbonyl group to form either a transient intermediate (a two-step process) or instead a formal transition state state as a concerted single-step mechanism.\n\n\nHow to do a SkiErg marathon entirely the wrong way (but still finish)\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/68s7b-8c778\nPublished October 13, 2023 in Chris von Csefalvay\nChris von Csefalvay\nYesterday, I completed a marathon on the SkiErg, with a pretty respectable time (see results here). I know I can do better, and I know I will do better. On the other hand, this was a marathon where I pretty much did everything wrong. And that was sort of an instructive experience in its own right. The title is somewhat misleading. Not much went wrong – the marathon itself was smooth sailing.\n\n\nBeyond Broca\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/vynvf-0k137\nPublished October 15, 2023 in Chris von Csefalvay\nChris von Csefalvay\nThere’s something special about language. It is ‘our own’, it is ‘us’, in a profound way, and quite surprisingly, more so than art. I was deeply struck by this when I first saw reactions to large generative language models that created realistic, human-ish prose.\n\n\nNetworking, For Skeptics\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/m6bp0-gn270\nPublished October 16, 2023 in Corin Wagen\nCorin Wagen\nScientists, engineers, and other technical people often make fun of networking. Until a few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking was some dumb activity done by business students who didn’t have actual work to do, or something exploitative focused on pure self-advancement.\n\n\nClustering Book editions\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/4hd4r-1tk44\nPublished October 16, 2023 in Sven Lieber\nSven Lieber\nWhat do the books “The invention of Nature” and “De uitvinder van de natuur” have in common? Well, they are both different versions of the same work, “The invention of nature” by Andrea Wulf, whether it is in a different format or a different language. In this blog post I will briefly introduce the advantages of keeping work-level records in library catalogs.\n\n\nScience and Society need more interaction instead of mere communication. An Interview with Volker Meyer-Guckel\nPublished October 17, 2023 in Elephant in the Lab\nSascha Schönig\nScience communication is often considered equal with public relations or media coverage. However, the phenomenon is significantly more complex, and its most important aspects are not given enough attention. For instance, science includes how science can not only communicate but also interact with societal groups, and the potential impacts this can have on the perception of research in the public eye.\n\n\nFAIR Data Digest #19\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/x2wm8-5qn53\nPublished October 17, 2023 in FAIR Data Digest\nSven Lieber\nHi everyone, welcome back to today’s edition in which I share a work update related to bibliographic data and provide information to an upcoming interesting talk. Thanks for reading FAIR Data Digest! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. 🏢 Books exist in many different versions. The same book might be published as paperback or as ebook and that even in different translations.\n\n\nBuilding a Community of Practice: Observations of the Current Use of DataCite DOIs as Project IDs\nhttps://doi.org/10.54900/g4928-wva21\nPublished October 17, 2023 in Upstream\nErin Robinson, Ted Habermann\nWe analyse samples of DataCite metadata from ten repositories that have already created &gt;100k project IDs. The FAIR Island Project will provide working examples that demonstrate how DataCite and other existing infrastructure are being used and can be leveraged to support project-level metadata.\n\n\nOpenCitations needs you: support the change in research practices\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/canw4-3xd10\nPublished October 17, 2023 in OpenCitations Blog\nChiara Di Giambattista\nIn OpenCitations, we like to define our infrastructure organization as “community-based” and “community-driven”, and we really mean it. The support coming from the number of academic libraries and consortia coming after OpenCitations’ involvement in the 2nd SCOSS funding cycle has made it possible, starting from 2020, to make OpenCitations develop from a small university project based on time-limited grant incomes to being an open infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Its a metallocene arranged in the form of a ring comprising 18 sub-units.[1] Big enough to deserve a 3D model rather than the static images you almost invariably get in journals (and C&EN). So how does one go to the journal and acquire the coordinates for such a model?\n\n\nThe ribs of Brachiosaurus: stranger than you thought\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/kyae8-p9k09 Published December 30, 2023 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMike TaylorAs we’ve often observed, it’s a funny thing that incredibly well-known dinosaur specimens can sit around for decades, or for more than a century, before someone notices something fascinating about them. One lesson to learn from this is the importance of collections — their creation, maintenance and accessibility.\n\n\nRunning Around: 2023 running dataviz in R\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/mw56m-xhs52 Published December 31, 2023 in quantixedStephen Royle2023 has been a great year in running for me. Previous running round-ups are here (2022, 2021). My two main goals for 2023 were to run 3000 km and also to run 50 HM-or-more distance runs. I managed both with a couple of weeks left.

The world’s changing so rapidly, it is increasingly hard to come to grips with things big and small. This even though there is a desire to jump to quick conclusions (a typical sign of overconfidence!). As a result of being stuck in my head, I have been absent on here.
