### [More examples of ‚Äúdouble-headed‚Äù curly arrows: S and C Nucleophiles attacking acetyl chloride](https://doi.org/10.59350/h7vdj-cky15)

In an earlier post on this topic, I described how the curly-arrows describing the mechanism of a nucleophilic addition at a carbonyl group choreograph in two distinct ways, as seen in red or blue below. The arrows in red can be described as firstly addition to the carbonyl group to form either a transient intermediate (a two-step process) or instead a formal transition state state as a concerted single-step mechanism.

### [How to do a SkiErg marathon entirely the wrong way (but still finish)](https://doi.org/10.59350/68s7b-8c778)

Yesterday, I completed a marathon on the SkiErg, with a pretty respectable time (see results here). I know I can do better, and I know I will do better. On the other hand, this was a marathon where I pretty much did everything wrong. And that was sort of an instructive experience in its own right. The title is somewhat misleading. Not much went wrong ‚Äì the marathon itself was smooth sailing.

There‚Äôs something special about language. It is ‚Äòour own‚Äô, it is ‚Äòus‚Äô, in a profound way, and quite surprisingly, more so than art. I was deeply struck by this when I first saw reactions to large generative language models that created realistic, human-ish prose.

### [Networking, For Skeptics](https://doi.org/10.59350/m6bp0-gn270)

Scientists, engineers, and other technical people often make fun of networking. Until a few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking was some dumb activity done by business students who didn‚Äôt have actual work to do, or something exploitative focused on pure self-advancement.

What do the books ‚ÄúThe invention of Nature‚Äù and ‚ÄúDe uitvinder van de natuur‚Äù have in common? Well, they are both different versions of the same work, ‚ÄúThe invention of nature‚Äù by Andrea Wulf, whether it is in a different format or a different language. In this blog post I will briefly introduce the advantages of keeping work-level records in library catalogs.

### [Science and Society need more interaction instead of mere communication. An Interview with Volker Meyer-Guckel](https://elephantinthelab.org/science-and-society-need-more-interaction-instead-of-mere-communication-an-interview-with-volker-meyer-guckel)

_Science communication is often considered equal with public relations or media coverage. However, the phenomenon is significantly more complex, and its most important aspects are not given enough attention. For instance, science includes how science can not only communicate but also interact with societal groups, and the potential impacts this can have on the perception of research in the public eye._

We analyse samples of DataCite metadata from ten repositories that have already created >100k project IDs. The FAIR Island Project will provide working examples that demonstrate how DataCite and other existing infrastructure are being used and can be leveraged to support project-level metadata.

In OpenCitations, we like to define our infrastructure organization as ‚Äúcommunity-based‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity-driven‚Äù, and we really mean it. The support coming from the number of academic libraries and consortia coming after OpenCitations‚Äô involvement in the 2nd SCOSS funding cycle has made it possible, starting from 2020, to make OpenCitations develop from a small university project based on time-limited grant incomes to being an open infrastructure.
