Newsletters have been around forever, but their popularity has significantly increased in the past few years, also thanks to platforms such as Ghost, Medium, and Substack. Which of course also includes science newsletters.

Soooo, my last job at Deck was amazing. I loved it. I was doing data engineer stuff there, mostly maintaining infrastructure for data pipelines. Everyone was great and the mission was amazing: helping Democrats win. Yet the company was shut down about a month ago, sending me on another job search, the 3rd since early/mid 2021.

Once again, weâ€™re looking to grow our editorial team at JOSS! Since our launch in May 2016, our existing editorial team has handled nearly 3000 submissions (2182 published at the time of writing, 265 under review) and the demand from the community continues to be strong. JOSS now consistently publishes a little over one paper per day, and we see no sign of this demand dropping.

Welcome to Stasis, an academic blog on polarization, internal conflict, and reconciliation in antiquity.
