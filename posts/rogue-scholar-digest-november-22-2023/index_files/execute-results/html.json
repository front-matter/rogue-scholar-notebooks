Traditionally, this journey involved wading through static pages and search indexes, a process both time-consuming and fraught with uncertainty.\n\n\n### [Back to class: Reflections from the 2023 CWTS Summer School](https://doi.org/10.59350/5c8gk-rt461)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/5c8gk-rt461](https://doi.org/10.59350/5c8gk-rt461)\n<br />Published November 16, 2023 in [Scholarly Communications Lab | ScholCommLab](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/scholcommlab)<br />Olivia Aguiar<br /><br />The Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) hosted their fifth Scientometrics Summer School (CS\n<sup>\n 3\n</sup>\n) from September 18-26, 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. CS\n<sup>\n 3\n</sup>\nturns theoretical ideas into hands-on research by engaging scientometrics graduate students with data, methods, and techniques used in the field. ScholCommLab members Chantal Ripp, Maddie Hare, Leigh-Ann Butler, and Rémi Toupin attended this year’s event.\n\n\n### [Two thoughts on blogging: thought archives, and bullets dodged](https://doi.org/10.59350/29yxb-qh763)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/29yxb-qh763](https://doi.org/10.59350/29yxb-qh763)\n<br />Published November 16, 2023 in [Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/svpow)<br />Matt Wedel<br /><br />I haven’t blogged about blogging in a while. Maybe because blogging already feels distinctly old-fashioned in the broader culture. A lot of the active discussion migrated away a long time ago, to Facebook and Twitter, and then to other social media outlets as each one in turn goes over the enshittification event horizon.\n\n\n### [R-universe now builds WASM binaries for all R packages](https://doi.org/10.59350/bkag3-csz91)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/bkag3-csz91](https://doi.org/10.59350/bkag3-csz91)\n<br />Published November 17, 2023 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />Jeroen Ooms<br /><br />Abstract / TLDR  R-universe now builds WASM binaries of all R packages for use in WebR applications (such as shinylive). For example to test the dev version of dplyr, you can open the WebR demo page and run:install.packages('dplyr',  repos = c('https://tidyverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://repo.r-wasm.org')) As explained below, not all R packages are supported yet;\n\n\n### [Kudos to PCI Registered Reports](https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170](https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170)\n<br />Published November 19, 2023 in [A blog by Ross Mounce](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/rossmounce)<br />Ross Mounce<br /><br />This is just a quick post of appreciation for PCI Registered Reports. I’ve recently joined the PCI RR community as a ‘recommender‘.    One thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was deeply insufficient.\n\n\n### [Political microtargeting](https://doi.org/10.59350/3bzex-66903)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/3bzex-66903](https://doi.org/10.59350/3bzex-66903)\n<br />Published November 20, 2023 in [Chris Hartgerink](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/chjh)<br />Chris Hartgerink<br /><br />Inching towards the Dutch elections, increasing amounts of claims are being made about the (micro)targeting of different campaigns. Here are some: New Social Contract does not do any online ads. The Greens-Labour Party spent €323,000 - more than twice as much as the Democrats 66 (D66), who spent €153,000. The Think (Denk) Party is profiling for Turkish ethnicity. The senior 50PLUS party microtargeted on people who listen to Angerfist.\n\n\n### [Empowering Open Science: Donate to Support our Mission](https://doi.org/10.59350/9den0-fmz94)\n[https://doi.org/10.59350/9den0-fmz94](https://doi.org/10.59350/9den0-fmz94)\n<br />Published November 21, 2023 in [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci)<br />The rOpenSci Team<br /><br />rOpenSci is a nonprofit organization that is funded entirely by grants and donations.

Our application here was finding the surface area of a cell but it can be used on any shape. We start with a 3D point set, specified by points of interest in a single cell imaged by 3D confocal microscopy.\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
