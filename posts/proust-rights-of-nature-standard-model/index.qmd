How Alzheimer’s caregivers are pulled into their patients’ worlds.

### [Rights of Nature Reach Europe]()
In September 2022, the Spanish Senate in the "Mar Menor Act" recognized a natural entity as a subject of rights – for the first time in Europe.

### [The standard model of particle physics passed one of its strictest tests yet](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/standard-model-particle-physics)
New experiments accurately predict the magnetic properties of an electron, part of the standard model of particle physics.

### [What We Know about the Possible Carcinogen Found in Zantac](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-we-know-about-the-possible-carcinogen-found-in-zantac/)
The widely used medication ranitidine for reducing gastric acid was withdrawn from most markets worldwide a few years ago.

### [The Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.1314859)
The original proposal for basic rules that open scholarly infrastructure should follow. Adopted by Crossref and an increasing number of infrastructure providers.
