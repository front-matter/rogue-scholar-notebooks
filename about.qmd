Syldavia Gazette is an independent publication launched in February 2023 by Martin Fenner. The gazette publishes summaries of science stories found elsewhere on the web. Starting in August 2023, the gazette curates blog posts from the [Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org) science blog archive. You can browse the blog posts, use the RSS feed, subscribe to the newsletter, and/or follow the gazette in the Fediverse.
