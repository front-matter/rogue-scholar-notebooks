This is post number 465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and hosting location – but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few guest posts).

The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.\n\n\nWhat’s going on with Oculudentavis?\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77Published July 22, 2020 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMike TaylorBack in March, Nature published “Hummingbird-sized dinosaur from the Cretaceous period of Myanmar” by Xing et al. (2020), which described and named a tiny putative bird that was preserved in amber from Myanmar (formerly Burma). It’s a pretty spectacular find. Today, though, that paper is retracted. That’s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper.\n\n\nSuppression as a form of liberation?\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12Published July 3, 2020 in A blog by Ross MounceRoss MounceOn Monday 29th June 2020, I learned from Retraction Watch that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of Journal Impact Factor ™ has newly “suppressed” 33 journals from their indexing service.\n\n\nThe R2R debate, part 1: opening statement in support\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/c8fz7-kyc20Published February 27, 2020 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMike TaylorThis Monday and Tuesday, I was at the R2R (Researcher to Reader) conference at BMA House in London.\n\n\nGuest Blog: Data in the time of Coronavirus\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/qh3na-ehy20Published February 4, 2020 in GigaBlogScott EdmundsWith much of the GigaScience team spanning the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border and now confined to remote working, the current 2019-novel coronavirus outbreak has been particularly disruptive and close to home.\n\n\nThe lowest common denominator: marketing science with jIF\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/8wafm-6yc04Published July 8, 2016 in GigaBlogScott EdmundsShallow Impact.

I saw this post with a bar chart to visualise these citations. It didn’t quite capture what the effect (if any) a retraction has on citations. I thought I’d quickly plot this out for the number one article on the list. The plot is pretty depressing. The retraction has no effect on citations.\n\n\nThe Medical Journal of Australia vs Elsevier\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28Published May 6, 2015 in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the WeekMatt WedelWhile Mike’s been off having fun at the Royal Society, this has been happening: Lots of feathers flying right now over the situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA).

So please read the MOSIS piece before starting this one.\n\n\nMOSIS\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/xbf04-2d058Published November 5, 2023 in FreakTakesEric GilliamThe 1980s DARPA ‘Silicon Broker’\n\n\nThe skeuomorphic fallacy\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/k9kka-90x56Published November 6, 2023 in Chris von CsefalvayChris von CsefalvayIt appears that in what is clearly a wonderful little PR stunt, a Polish rum company managed to do a Sophia and appoint an ‘AI-driven’ ‘robot’ as its ‘CEO’. The other guilty party to this pile of steaming bovine excrement is Hanson Robotics, famous for giving us Sophia, the “world’s first robot citizen”. Most of what I’m saying here goes just as well for Sophia.\n\n\nThe rOpenSci Multiverse\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/g7mpc-1ek03Published November 6, 2023 in rOpenSci - open tools for open scienceAlejandra Bellini, Yanina Bellini SaibeneThe R-Universe is used by professionals from different fields, although they all pursue the same objective: to offer their R packages in a simple and accessible way. At rOpenSci we work to provide tools that facilitate access to data and research software generated with good software development practices and in a friendly community.\n\n\nBook Review: Hunt, Gather, Parent\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/yk9tw-49h03Published November 6, 2023 in Corin WagenCorin Wagen“Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one’s youth.” –Psalm 127:4 What if our most fundamental assumptions about parenting were wrong? That’s the question that Michaeleen Doucleff’s 2021 book Hunt, Gather, Parent tries to tackle.\n\n\nWhat happens to science when it communicates?\nhttps://elephantinthelab.org/what-happens-to-science-when-it-communicatesPublished November 7, 2023 in Elephant in the LabSascha SchönigWhat actually happens to science when it opens up? From your perspective as a science researcher, can you describe why this perspective is important? I believe that science takes place in a social environment and certain images of science emerge or have emerged, which are questioned in many respects in a digital and now increasingly open context or are subject to tensions.\n\n\nType I Error Rates are Not Usually Inflated\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573Published November 7, 2023 in Critical MetascienceMark RubinThe inflation of Type I error rates is thought to be one of the causes of the replication crisis. Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this new article, I offer an alternative view.\n\n\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI) version 1.1: Reflections from adopters\nhttps://doi.org/10.54900/n6az7-4xb07Published November 7, 2023 in UpstreamGinny HendricksThe Upstream platform was created in order to discuss all things open. Open scholarly infrastructure and the need for the community to assess such infrastructures are surely at the heart of enabling the open research movement.\n\n\nHeading for #SfN23 with two posters\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/832s7-0fz24Published November 7, 2023 in bjoern.brembs.blogBjörn BrembsIt’s the time of the year again where 30,000 neuroscientists head to the US to talk neuroscience. This year the big annual conference is in Washington, DC, one of the three cities able to host this large event. Our first poster will be up on Tuesday morning and shows results from operant self-stimulation experiments using optogenetics and dopaminergic neurons.\n\n\nThe Autonomous Land Vehicle, Pilot’s Associate, and Battle Management\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/bts7h-31866Published November 7, 2023 in FreakTakesEric GilliamThree North Star Applications Projects from DARPA’s Strategic Computing Portfolio\n\n\nIntroducing the CWTS ECR/PhD Council\nhttps://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-ecr-phd-councilPublished November 8, 2023 in Leiden MadtricsLeiden MadtricsIn this blog post, we’ll introduce you to the CWTS ECR/PhD Council, shedding light on its significance, objectives, and how it can serve as a crucial resource for early career researchers and PhDs at CWTS. CWTS is an interdisciplinary institute at Leiden University with a diverse multinational academic culture. PhD candidates, early career researchers, and visiting scholars from around the world gather at CWTS to pursue their research journeys.\n\n\nBioBanking at GGBN 2023: Highlights from GigaScience Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/ahnf6-e1m90Published November 8, 2023 in GigaBlogChris Armit“Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.” –Sir David Attenborough, Sept 30th 2020 The fourth international Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) Conference took place in Aguascalientes, Mexico from October 17th to October 20th 2023 where it was hosted by the Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes.\n\n\nFrom Ottawa to Leiden: ScholCommLab’s Conference Highlights\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/vbp1j-f9j63Published November 9, 2023 in Scholarly Communications Lab | ScholCommLabOlivia AguiarOver the last few months, ScholCommLab members took part in over six conferences, including the: International Conference on Science, Technology, and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023), International Communication Association Conference (ICA 2023), and Bibliometrics and Research Impact Community Conference (BRIC 2023). In this blog post, we’re sharing highlights from each event.\n\n\nArchiving Rogue Scholar blogs with the Internet Archive\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/g60vh-3ng48Published November 9, 2023 in Front MatterMartin FennerBlogs participating in the Rogue Scholar science blog archive are now archived in the Internet Archive.
