Sign up&nbsp;here! Papermilling has a few definitions which you see here and there.\n\n### This blog turned 15 (years old) this month\nPublished in Front Matter\nhttps://doi.org/10.53731/bs60jms-sqaehsk\nThe first post on this blog was published on August 3, 2007 (Open access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research). This is post number 465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and hosting location – but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly communication.\n\n### When your journal reads you\nPublished in Elephant in the Lab\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; Renke Siems  In December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted by the Coalition for Networked Information. The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.\n\n### What’s going on with &lt;i&gt;Oculudentavis&lt;/i&gt;?\nPublished in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/hk3jx-6sv77\nBack in March, Nature published “Hummingbird-sized dinosaur from the Cretaceous period of Myanmar” by Xing et al. (2020), which described and named a tiny putative bird that was preserved in amber from Myanmar (formerly Burma). It’s a pretty spectacular find. Today, though, that paper is retracted. That’s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper.\n\n### Suppression as a form of liberation?\nPublished in A blog by Ross Mounce\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\nOn Monday 29th June 2020, I learned from Retraction Watch that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of &lt;em&gt;Journal Impact Factor&lt;/em&gt; ™  has newly “suppressed”   33 journals from their indexing service.\n\n### The R2R debate, part 1: opening statement in support\nPublished in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/c8fz7-kyc20\nThis Monday and Tuesday, I was at the R2R (Researcher to Reader) conference at BMA House in London.\n\n### Guest Blog: Data in the time of Coronavirus\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/qh3na-ehy20\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;With much of the GigaScience team spanning the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border and now confined to remote working, the current 2019-novel coronavirus outbreak has been particularly disruptive and close to home.\n\n### The lowest common denominator: marketing science with jIF\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/8wafm-6yc04\n&lt;strong&gt;Shallow Impact. Tis the season. &lt;/strong&gt;In case people didn’t know— the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season, which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors come back from holidays to tackle the glut.\n\n### My Blank Pages V: Raw Data\nPublished in quantixed\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/j2nba-89g15\n&lt;strong&gt;Raw Data: A novel on Life in Science&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Pernille Rørth&lt;/strong&gt; (Springer, 2016)    I was keen to read this “lab lit” novel written by renowned cell biologist Pernille Rørth. I’d seen lots of enthusiastic comments about the book, and it didn’t disappoint.\n\n### What Difference Does It Make?\nPublished in quantixed\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/cmyz9-ms451\nA few days ago, Retraction Watch published the top ten most-cited retracted papers. I saw this post with a bar chart to visualise these citations. It didn’t quite capture what the effect (if any) a retraction has on citations. I thought I’d quickly plot this out for the number one article on the list.    The plot is pretty depressing. The retraction has no effect on citations.\n\n### The &lt;i&gt;Medical Journal of Australia&lt;/i&gt; vs Elsevier\nPublished in Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/6m0m9-bng28\nWhile Mike’s been off having fun at the Royal Society, this has been happening: Lots of feathers flying right now over the situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA). The short, short version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and […]\n\n### Getting Techy With It: GigaScience Technology Update 2014\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/tzayy-hvn20\nWhen it comes to technology, &lt;em&gt;GigaScience&lt;/em&gt; has always been open and willing to embrace new ways of integrating technology in its publishing processes, with the ultimate goal of working towards more reproducible, interactive and executable papers.\n\n### Continuing the push beyond static documents. ISMB, and more on our “What Bioinformaticians need to know about digital publishing beyond the PDF2” workshop\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/gtw2x-fc921\n&lt;strong&gt;Boston 2014: More than a (Bioinformatics) Feeling&lt;/strong&gt; Following from our previous posting on BOSC, our birthday and the BMC Open Data award party in Boston, on top of having to dash between the many great talks and sessions at ISMB, we were kept even busier than usual helping to organize and present in a special Beyond-the-PDF inspired “What Bioinformaticians need to know about digital publishing beyond the PDF” workshop at the end\n\n### Rewarding Reproducibility: First Papers in our Galaxy Series utilizing our GigaGalaxy platform\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/w8kyr-0e629\n&lt;strong&gt;Push the button! &lt;em&gt;GigaScience&lt;/em&gt; moves toward more interactive articles&lt;/strong&gt; Research articles are being published with increasingly large and complicated supporting datasets, together with the software code used in analyses of the data.\n\n### The difficulties sharing neuroscience data: can data publishing help?\nPublished in GigaBlog\nhttps://doi.org/10.59350/kmne3-5xg86\nLast week we published our first neuroscience data note containing 10GB of fMRI data hosted and integrated into the paper by a DOI to our GigaDB database. While we have published a number of genomics datasets and data notes (see the Puerto Rican Parrot genome data note and its associated data DOI), this is a nice example of us providing a home for “orphan data”, the long tail of data types without community agreed curated repositories."
