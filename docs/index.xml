<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ropensci-multiverse">The rOpenSci Multiverse</h2>
<p>Published November 6, 2023 in rOpenSci - open tools for open science Alejandra Bellini, Yanina Bellini Saibene https://doi.org/10.59350/g7mpc-1ek03</p>
<p>The R-Universe is used by professionals from different fields, although they all pursue the same objective: to offer their R packages in a simple and accessible way. At rOpenSci we work to provide tools that facilitate access to data and research software generated with good software development practices and in a friendly community.</p>

<p>Published November 6, 2023 in Corin Wagen Corin Wagen https://doi.org/10.59350/yk9tw-49h03</p>
<p>“Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one’s youth.” –Psalm 127:4 What if our most fundamental assumptions about parenting were wrong? That’s the question that Michaeleen Doucleff’s 2021 book Hunt, Gather, Parent tries to tackle.</p>

<section id="what-happens-to-science-when-it-communicates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-happens-to-science-when-it-communicates">What happens to science when it communicates?</h2>
<p>Published November 7, 2023 in Elephant in the Lab Sascha Schönig https://elephantinthelab.org/what-happens-to-science-when-it-communicates</p>
<p>What actually happens to science when it opens up? From your perspective as a science researcher, can you describe why this perspective is important? I believe that science takes place in a social environment and certain images of science emerge or have emerged, which are questioned in many respects in a digital and now increasingly open context or are subject to tensions.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-i-error-rates-are-not-usually-inflated" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="type-i-error-rates-are-not-usually-inflated">Type I Error Rates are Not Usually Inflated</h2>
<p>Published November 7, 2023 in Critical Metascience Mark Rubin https://doi.org/10.59350/88njp-0d573</p>
<p>The inflation of Type I error rates is thought to be one of the causes of the replication crisis. Questionable research practices such as p-hacking are thought to inflate Type I error rates above their nominal level, leading to unexpectedly high levels of false positives in the literature and, consequently, unexpectedly low replication rates. In this new article, I offer an alternative view.</p>

<section id="principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure-posi-version-1.1-reflections-from-adopters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure-posi-version-1.1-reflections-from-adopters">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI) version 1.1: Reflections from adopters</h2>
<p>Published November 7, 2023 in Upstream Ginny Hendricks https://doi.org/10.54900/n6az7-4xb07</p>
<p>The Upstream platform was created in order to discuss all things open. Open scholarly infrastructure and the need for the community to assess such infrastructures are surely at the heart of enabling the open research movement.</p>
