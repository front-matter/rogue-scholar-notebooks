  such as Internet addresses, browser types, referring domains,
  timestamps (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), as
  well as the specific pages the visitor has requested. This information
  is anonymized upon collection and no personalized data is stored from
  users. This information is logged to help deliver a better user
  experience, diagnose technical problems, support marketing activities
  and so that we may better administer the Site and the Services in
